       " 'text': 'The book “Gardenlust: A Botanical Tour of the World’s Best New Gardens” by Christopher Woods (Timber Press, 416 pages, $40) shows you gardens from around the globe, including some surprising places such as Oman, Singapore and the island of Nevis in the West Indies, all of them created in the past 20 years. Fifty gardens or designers are featured. The sites are all engaging; some are breathtaking. Woods, the author and major photographer of the book, began his career as a gardener at Kew Gardens in London. He then worked at a number of public gardens in England and the U.S., including 20 years as director and chief designer of Chanticleer Arboretum in Pennsylvania. (I have been to Chanticleer and have seen the Ruins Garden he created there from the stone and slate ruins of the home of the original owner of the property. It’s a spectacular piece of garden art, which includes  the work of Berkeley garden sculptor Marcia Donahue.) Because Woods understands the need for well-planned garden form as well as for horticultural skill and knowledge, he gives us both perspectives in “Gardenlust.” You will learn the names and view the work of forward-looking garden designers the world over. You will also find discussions of certain soils and for important plants in each garden, their common as well as scientific names down to the often all-important cultivar name. I also enjoyed Woods’ explorations of some common themes in gardens of our new century. One of these themes is conservation through cultivation — bringing native plants into gardens to ensure their survival. One of many examples is Pad Te Ke Botanical Garden in Laos, where 250 of that nation’s 485 native orchids are being grown. Another is the Jardín de Salvias in Mar del Plata, Argentina, where a former Buenos Aires professor, Rolando Uría, has initiated a collection of salvia species. (I was particularly taken with a photograph of Salvia foveolata, a tall salvia species with light yellow flowers and dark red sepals.) A second common theme is environmental remediation. One example is the Naples Botanical Garden, in Naples, Fla., where a former shopping complex, garbage dump and parking lot has become a tropical paradise. Or consider Landschaftspark, in Duisburg-Nord, Germany, where the ruins of the former Thyssen smelting plant, which openly used slave labor during World War II,  is being redesigned into a park. Writes Woods: “Healing the wounds of history does not mean the expurgation of the past.” Here, the machinery that was used to create chemical and social toxins decays in place amid places to stroll, dance and play. A third theme is bringing nature into the hearts of our overcrowded cities. In Tokyo, Ichigaya Forest is being planted in open spaces between tall buildings. Here, native species are being allowed to form their usual untidy but wonderful forest mix, interrupted only by sidewalks taken by workers to and from their city jobs. Other urban plantings are on roofs or walls. In Singapore, exuberant plantings perch on concrete platforms several stories up, like shelf fungi on a tree. A fourth trend is a less formal style of gardening in which plantings appear to represent wild habitats, though only a portion of the plants used are truly native. Although a certain amount of reseeding and spreading is allowed, such plantings are nevertheless carefully curated and edited. This trend is also represented by the High Line in New York. (Not shown in this book. See the book “Gardens of the Highline,” Piet Oudolf and Rick Darke, Timber Press, 2017, which  I reviewed in this column  in June 2018). Woods shows and comments on several such “naturalistic” plantings. But, although the plantings are casual, they do require maintenance. Woods writes that he found the garden created for 2012 Olympics in London Olympic Park in such poor maintenance that “even benign neglect has been neglected.”  Other gardens, such as Junto Farm, a private garden in Hudson Valley, N.Y., and the public Martin Luther King Park in Paris, merit his high praise for both planting and maintenance. Threaded through the entries is much analysis of this trend. Woods calls it “a relaxed interpretation of nature, seeking not to overpower but to cohabit,” and says such plantings can “serve as a bridge between us and what we think of as untamed nature.” Nevertheless, he says, “there should be no pretense that they aren’t artificial.” That is, it should be clear that these gardens are not restorations of meadows and prairies that are truly gone. The book gains value in my eyes by the fact that over half of the gardens are public, and therefore visitable should you travel to where they are. Some are relatively near. For example, the Chihuly garden in Seattle where colored glass art plays against plants, or the Garden of Flowering Fragrance, a Chinese garden at the Huntington Botanical Garden in San Marino (Los Angeles County). Others are farther away, but who knows, life might take you to Sydney to stroll the modern abstract landscapes of the Australian Garden in the Royal Botanic Gardens, or to Said-Ul-Azaib, Delhi, India, to enjoy the contemplative splendor of the Garden of the Five Senses.

       "'More than 250,000 San Francisco homes and businesses are about to become customers of  CleanPowerSF , the municipal electricity program operated by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. In preparation for what will be the largest enrollment effort in the program’s history, the SFPUC began notifying residents and merchants this week that, by the spring, they’ll be receiving city-sourced electricity. The SFPUC has been automatically switching portions of the city into CleanPowerSF since 2016, and the agency has about 111,000 customers. In the coming months, the SFPUC expects to more than triple that number, with a projected enrollment of 360,000 dwellings by the end of April. Just over 3 percent of customers opt out of the program, according to the SFPUC, electing to keep Pacific Gas & Electric Co. as their power provider. Combined with the SFPUC’s Hetch Hetchy Power program, which uses greenhouse-gas-free energy primarily to power Muni vehicles and all the city-owned government buildings, the agency will be serving roughly 80 percent of San Francisco’s electricity demand by the end of April. “This is a big deal,” said Barbara Hale, SFPUC assistant general manager in charge of power. “We’re in every neighborhood, every block of the city, serving CleanPowerSF power.” In the coming months, CleanPowerSF’s expansion will overlap with deliberations that could  shape the direction of the city’s energy future . After PG&E’s bankruptcy  seemed inevitable  because of liabilities related to wildfires, Mayor London Breed instructed the SFPUC to start planning the city’s response to the utility’s insolvency and ensure that electricity flowed uninterrupted. One major part of that was determining whether the city could afford to buy PG&E’s infrastructure, which would allow San Francisco to have greater control over its energy needs. “The success of our CleanPowerSF program shows the city knows how to deliver renewable energy for San Franciscans, and acquiring more assets to deliver that clean energy is a priority,” Breed said. “If there is an opportunity, we will take it.” While CleanPowerSF procures the electricity, the program still relies on PG&E to distribute it, handle billing and address outages. Hale said the SFPUC is crunching the numbers on whether it makes financial sense over the long-term to buy PG&E’s equipment — like underground transformers, and transmission lines and substations — and take over billing customers. The agency is also considering what kind of workforce it might need to hire if it became a fully independent electrical utility. “We think about it as scaling up the services we already provide,” Hale said. “The meta-question we’re asking ourselves is: Can we provide reliable, safe, affordable electricity services ... and meet our financial metrics?” San Franciscans pay an estimated $300 million annually for electricity services like transmission and distribution. That’s money that, if the SFPUC became fully independent, the city could invest in improving and building out its electrical system and toward meeting its clean-energy goals. In addition to determining how much of the utility’s assets it could acquire, the SFPUC is also putting a price tag on repair and upkeep costs, as well as the costs of physically separating the assets it buys from the rest of PG&E’s distribution network. “It’s a giant math equation,” Hale said. Acquiring assets from PG&E would likely cost billions of dollars. But San Francisco voters approved a potential funding source in June when they passed Proposition A, a measure that allows the SFPUC to sell bonds to pay for clean-energy infrastructure, with the approval of the Board of Supervisors. Several board members, including Supervisors Hillary Ronen and Sandra Lee Fewer, have expressed interest in exploring what Ronen has called a “complete divorce” from PG&E. For the SFPUC, fleshing out its role as an electrical utility provider would also mean maintaining infrastructure it wasn’t previously responsible for, said Frank Wolak, a Stanford economics professor who directs the university’s Program on Energy and Sustainable Development. The city would also likely be responsible for responding to power outages and other customer-service tasks it currently doesn’t address. “You would literally have to hire trucks, workers, all of that, to be responsive when there are outages or repairs that have to be done — everything,” Wolak said. “More likely what would happen is ... the city would contract with PG&E to do those sorts of things.” And just because the city might be prepared to buy the assets doesn’t mean PG&E will be ready to sell. Much of PG&E’s financial future is now in the hands of the bankruptcy court, which makes it hard to say whether the company would be in a position to shed assets. “PG&E regularly evaluates the way the company is structured — strategically, operationally and financially — so that we are best positioned to operate efficiently and to provide safe and reliable service to our customers,” a PG&E spokesman said in an email. Hale said the utility has signaled a willingness to hear offers, “and I think it’s fair to say that if SFPUC brings a credible offer to PG&E and their shareholders and their board, they’ll give it careful consideration.”BEIJING (AP) — Asian stock markets were little-changed Thursday following a listless day on Wall Street ahead of U.S.-Chinese negotiations aimed at ending a tariff battle. Tokyo\\'s Nikkei 225 index lost 0.1 percent to 21,402.69 after a gauge of manufacturing activity fell to a three-year low, suggesting Japanese economic growth is slowing. The Shanghai Composite Index was unchanged at 2,762.67. Sydney\\'s S&P-ASX 200 added 0.4 percent to 6,120.50 while Hong Kong\\'s Hang Seng gained 9 points to 28,526.95. Seoul\\'s Kospi was unchanged at 2,230.15. Benchmarks in New Zealand and Taiwan advanced while Southeast Asian markets mostly declined. Investors looked ahead to talks in Washington on a fight over Beijing\\'s technology ambitions ahead of a March 2 deadline for a possible U.S. tariff hike. Neither government has released details but companies saw the decision to hold more talks as a sign of progress after a U.S. envoy said a meeting in Beijing last week \"made headway.\" President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday the talks were \"going very well.\" Trump has suggested he might postpone the tariff hike on $200 billion of goods but made no firm commitment. The U.S. Federal Reserve reassured investors by releasing minutes of its latest meeting saying, as expected, it will be patient with interest rate hikes amid economic uncertainty. Lack of details in the Fed\\'s report \"leaves the region to await further US-China developments,\" said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. After markets rose on Trump\\'s positive comments, she said, \"one should not be surprised\" to see more gains. The benchmark Standard & Poor\\'s 500 index gained 0.2 percent to 2,784.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2 percent to 25,954.44. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.03 percent to 7,489.07. Germany\\'s DAX, the FTSE 100 in London and France\\'s CAC 40 all gained 0.3 percent. JAPANESE MANUFACTURING: The preliminary reading on a monthly purchasing managers\\' index fell to 48.5 on a 100-point scale from January\\'s 50.3. It was the second unusually large monthly decline and the PMI\\'s lowest level since October 2016. \"Such large falls are rare and suggest that the economy is losing momentum rapidly,\" said Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics in a report. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 8 cents to $57.24 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gained 71 cents on Wednesday to $57.16. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 2 cents to $67.10 per barrel in London. It gained 63 cents the previous session to $67.08. CURRENCIES: The dollar edged down to 110.82 yen from Wednesday\\'s 110.85 yen. The euro gained to $1.1341 from $1.1336.Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed spending $50 million this fiscal year to expand child savings account programs similar to the one San Francisco started in 2010 when he was mayor. San Francisco’s program, called Kindergarten 2 College or K2C, automatically opens an account at Citibank for children entering a San Francisco public school and seeds it with $50. The city spends about $1 million a year on the program. Families who contribute to the account and register it online can get up to $90 in one-time matching funds, provided by donors and nonprofit organizations. Adrian Perez, a fourth-grader at John Muir Elementary, has $300 to $400 in his account, said his mother Dorothy Clark. She adds money and has family put in money at Christmas. “The fact that it’s there and matched to a certain amount, that motivated me to be serious and not just wait until college to think about it,” she said. She hopes that “by the time he’s 18, he won’t have to work as much to pay for college and take out loans.” San Francisco’s child savings account program is one of the oldest, but the idea is spreading fast. There are  65 programs  in 34 states, said Bob Friedman, founder of Prosperity Now, a nonprofit focused on financial mobility. About three-fourths require families to enroll. The others, like San Francisco’s, are automatic. Many are premised on research spearheaded by social work Professor William “Willie” Elliott, now at the University of Michigan. It found that children with a bank account designated for college, with $500 or less, were three to four times more likely to go to college than those without an account, Elliott said. However, the research did not find a causal relationship, meaning there’s no evidence that having a savings account made a child more likely to go to college. “It could be that children with savings accounts had parents who were more likely to take them to the library, make sure they do their homework” and do other things that put their kids on the path to college, said Michael Sherraden, professor of social work at Washington University in St. Louis. Sherraden is conducting a statewide experiment in Oklahoma to see if there is a causal relationship. Funded by the Ford Foundation, it gave $1,000 to a random sample of children at birth and matched their savings for four years. It’s comparing them to a control group of kids who didn’t get an account. The kids are now 11 so it’s too soon to determine their impact on college-going. “But I can say in causal terms, having an account with a deposit in it improves mothers’ expectations for a kid’s education, improves parenting practices in some important ways and improves a child’s emotional development,” Sherraden said. Meanwhile, cities and states are plowing ahead with programs.  In Maine,  every baby born since 2013 gets $500 deposited into a 529 college savings account, from a foundation established by the late shoe tycoon Harold Alfond. Starting this year, every baby born  in Pennsylvania  will get $100 deposited into a 529 account, gratis the state Treasury. St. Louis,   Boston  and  Lansing, Mich.,  have city-funded programs similar to San Francisco’s. They set up a bank or credit union account for students in their public schools and seed them with $50 or, in Lansing’s case, $10. At the national level, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., introduced  a bill  in December that would create an interest-bearing savings account for every baby born in America. It would be seeded with $1,000, and each year thereafter children would receive zero to $2,000 depending on family income. At 18, they could tap the account to buy a home or pay educational expenses. He’d pay for it by raising estate taxes to where they were in 2009. Booker’s plan is more like a universal basic income for kids, aimed at redistributing wealth, and funded entirely by government. By comparison, most state and local programs see the child savings account as a starting point. “It’s the plumbing for us to find other ways to get money into those accounts,” Elliott said. That money could come from family, nonprofits and spending-rewards cards. San Francisco’s program originally gave low-income students an additional $50 deposit. It doesn’t any longer, but does give schools with a large percentage of low-income students additional money from private sources they can allocate to student accounts. The students don’t actually own the accounts. Instead, the city set up a master account using its tax ID number with Citibank, which set up sub accounts for each child. “We know the name, age and school” for each child. That “insures they all have FDIC coverage,” said Bob Annibale, Citi’s global head of community development. It doesn’t collect the child’s tax ID number. The master account earns 0.15 percent a year and that rate, called a “growth incentive,” is credited to the child accounts. That way, parents don’t have to worry about taxes on the account while it’s growing, said city Treasurer and Tax Collector Jose Cisneros, whose office runs the program. Families can’t withdraw money, including their own contributions, until the child graduates from high school. At that point, the money can be spent only on postsecondary educational expenses. The city hasn’t figured out how it will make sure the money is spent that way. Nor has it determined if or how it will report the account to the Internal Revenue Service. “We still have a few years before we figure out the exact mechanics of the disbursement,” Cisneros said. “One idea I had: Take all the contributions, growth, incentives, etc., and put it into custodial 529 accounts. If there is any need to report it (to the IRS), we’ll do it at that time.” The city considered opening K2C accounts with the state’s 529 college saving plan, called ScholarShare. Those accounts can be invested in the stock market, which generally return more than bank accounts over many years. And the tax treatment is well established: There is no federal deduction for contributions to 529 accounts, but the money grows tax-free and withdrawals are tax-free if used for higher education. If not, the account earnings are subject to tax and penalty. K2C can’t offer that tax break. However, if San Francisco opened a 529 account for a student, no one else could contribute to it. Parents could open their own 529 account for the child and contribute to it, although that’s a bit of work and requires Social Security or federal tax ID numbers for the parent and child. “A core value (for K2C) was making it automatic and universal,” Cisneros cites. Programs that use 529 plans for the child savings account typically link it to a 529 account set up by the parents. K2C has more than 34,000 accounts and $6.5 million in assets, including $4 million put in by families. About 20 percent of families have made deposits; their average contribution is $559. The program offers field trips to Citibank for kindergarten and first-grade classes. On Thursday, Ran Suzuki took her first-graders from Cobb Elementary to a branch on Van Ness Avenue, where they got to make a deposit, check out the ATM, visit the safe deposit box vault and take home a Lego bank. “I wish I had this program with my two older kids,” said Rufina Gillette, who chaperoned the trip with her son Jonta. “It’s better to learn at a young age. It gives them self-confidence to have their own account.” Jennifer Jennings is contributing $10 a month to K2C accounts for her kids “to get the incentive,” she said. “I figure it’s free money, whether it’s interest bearing or not.” She also has 529 accounts for her children Charlotte and James Velasquez, who are in kindergarten and second grade, respectively, at Buena Vista Elementary. “I also tell them every chance I get that they are going to college. I want them to think it’s not optional. One trick I use: My daughter wants pink hair. I tell her, ‘College is the perfect time to have pink hair.’ She even repeats that to me.” In  his 2019-20 budget,  Newsom proposed spending $50 million to support pilot projects and partnerships “that will support development or strengthening of cost-effective models that can be replicated or expanded to increase access to Child Savings Accounts among incoming kindergartners.” His office declined to provide any specifics. In Oakland, the Brilliant Baby program will deposit $500 into a 529 account for children born into families eligible for Medi-Cal. For now, parents must open the account in Utah’s 529 plan through one of seven social service agencies. It has funded 370 accounts, but by 2025 hopes to fund them for all 2,200 babies born per year in Oakland into Medi-Cal families. The money comes from philanthropy. Brilliant Baby is part of Oakland Promise, a larger program that has different strategies for children at different stages of life. Children in Oakland’s public elementary schools whose parents open a 529 account can get $50 plus another $50 if they make six deposits in the first year. That program is in 52 of the city’s public elementary schools and will expand to all 75 within two years.In a rush to beat its rival Uber to the public market, Lyft is preparing to start trading in early April, according to two people familiar with the company’s plans. Lyft intends to begin its roadshow, in which it meets with investors to talk up the initial public offering, the week of March 18, the two people said. Companies usually start trading a week or so after a roadshow. If Lyft wins this race, it will be the first ride-hailing company to go public. The two San Francisco companies have been locked in a competition to go public, with Lyft facing pressure to be first to avoid being overshadowed by Uber, which is much larger. The startup, founded in 2007 by Logan Green and John Zimmer, is one of several tech companies pushing to go public early this year. Slack and Pinterest, both also San Francisco companies, are among the others. Lyft and Uber declined to comment. The two app-based ride services have competed fiercely for customers and drivers since their earliest days, often introducing copycat services within days of each other. In keeping with that tradition, both filed to go public with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the same day in early December. The review of their filings stalled briefly when the government partially shut down later that month. The review process may take longer for Uber than for Lyft because Uber is involved in several secondary businesses, like food and freight deliveries. Uber and Lyft both operate bike and scooter services, as well as self-driving car development wings. Lyft will be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and expects to be valued at between $20 billion and $25 billion, according to the people familiar with the company’s plans. The details about Lyft’s roadshow were initially reported by Reuters. The Lyft listing is a win for Nasdaq, which struggled to attract tech companies after the exchange suffered delays and technical problems during Facebook’s IPO. It has faced tough competition from the New York Stock Exchange for new tech listings. In the aftermath of the Facebook fumble, tech firms like Square, Twitter and Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, went public on the Big Board. Lyft was last valued by private investors at $15.1 billion and has selected JPMorgan Chase to lead its public offering.One of San Francisco’s last traditional men’s clothing stores, a Financial District institution that teetered on the brink of closing after half a century, may stay open under new owners. The Hound Gentlemen’s Clothiers, in the 100-year-old Hallidie Building at 140 Sutter St., had struggled amid competition from online retailers and changing style preferences. With its lease expiring in April, and its owners looking toward retirement, it is negotiating to transfer ownership to Patrick James Inc., a Fresno manufacturer and seller of men’s clothing and accessories. Patrick James would take over the lease and operate the store under the Hound name. Under the terms of the deal, the Hound’s current owners, Walt Schorno, 81 and Mike Blunden, 75, would continue to work two days a week at the shop. “My fondest memories over the years are of my customers,” Schorno said in between helping customers find dress shirts and jackets. “We’ve gotten to know them well, sometimes outfitting different generations of the same family.” Schorno thought the Hound would have to close this month after 46 years in business. With his 82nd birthday approaching, Schorno said, he planned to dial back some of his work responsibilities. He said he and Blunden did not want to sign another long-term lease, but they hoped the space could remain a men’s clothing store. If the deal goes through, he said, he can continue doing what he loves. And if certain sales goals are met, both he and Blunden would have a small share in profits. When Schorno started the Hound in 1972 in a 400-square-foot space in the Flatiron Building, there were about 200 menswear shops in the city. A few — like Brooks Brothers and Cable Car Clothiers — still exist. But online competition has stiffened in recent years, and companies like Knot Standard, a New York luxury menswear company, and Amsterdam’s Suit Supply, both of which also have stores in downtown San Francisco, have cut into the business of stores like the Hound that rely on knowledgeable salespeople and in-house tailoring. The Hound does not even have a website. Workplace attire has also changed, said Brian Kilcourse, managing partner at Retail Systems Research in Miami. Tech workers wearing T-shirts and jeans “are reasons why lots of high-end fashion businesses have gone out of business,” he said. “I do miss people coming into the store with a necktie and suit,” Schorno said. Patrick Mon Pere Jr., whose father started the Patrick James company in 1962, said that terms are being negotiated with the building owners, and an agreement should be finalized in two weeks. The Hallidie Building has traditionally been home to men’s retail on the ground floor, though the clothing warehouses on the upper floors have given way to offices, said Ed Conner, co-owner of the building. “We have an interest in preserving the Hound name and the legacy it has,” Mon Pere said. Patrick James’ online and catalog business accounts for half of its sales, and offerings from the Hound will be added to Patrick James catalogs. Some Hound customers prefer the store to the internet. The attention to detail and the variety of styles have kept retired teacher Tom Bostock, 68, coming back. “Shopping online, you can’t feel the texture and weight of the fabric,” he said. Schorno said the Hound’s annual revenue has averaged $2.5 million over the past five years. The price of a suit runs about $1,000. “We’ve managed, even though we’ve stayed fairly flat, because of our customers,” he said. The Hound plans to stay open until at least March 8, then reopen in April or May under new ownership. Schorno said he’ll keep the store open with limited hours during the transition. The shop is selling merchandise for 50 percent off, and is also offering five ties for free.Following orders from a federal judge who has  sharply criticized  its safety record, PG&E filed a response in court Friday painting itself as a changed utility that has learned from past tragedies caused by its equipment and understands that a drier, hotter state needs more effective wildfire prevention. The company, however, told U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing PG&E’s federal probation, it cannot assure him it is in total compliance with state laws that dictate vegetation clearance around power lines. “Given the dynamic conditions of vegetation, it is impossible for a utility to achieve perfect compliance or to represent that it is in full compliance at all times,” PG&E attorneys wrote in the court filings. The company also responded — paragraph by paragraph, according to Alsup’s unusual order — to a series of claims by a pair of private attorneys who represent victims of blazes largely sparked by the company’s equipment. The lawyers questioned the utility’s wildfire prevention history, alleging the company is more concerned with its image and finances than dangerous conditions in fire-prone areas. Friday’s flurry of filings punctuate a wild ride for PG&E since Alsup took a fresh look at the utility’s behavior after reports of malfunctions on its equipment near the origin of the Camp Fire — the state’s deadliest and most destructive wildfire — indicated the utility may have played a role in last year’s blaze. Alsup ruled last month that the utility  violated its probation terms  by failing to promptly report a 2017 Butte County fire blamed on the company’s equipment to its probation officer. PG&E was convicted of multiple felonies stemming from a deadly 2010 gas pipeline explosion in San Bruno. With wide latitude in his PG&E oversight, Alsup has threatened to impose a massive overhaul on PG&E’s probation terms that the company warned  would cost billions of dollars,  require an army of new workers and send customers’ rates soaring. The judge has asked for insight from regulators, state fire officials and others on how he can create a safe path forward for the company, even taking the step of asking private attorneys representing victims of blazes for their input. In his Feb. 14 order, Alsup asked PG&E to clarify if it would take 10 years for the company to complete “enhanced” vegetation removal work around power lines in high-threat areas. The company said Friday it would take about eight years to finish the 25,200 circuit miles in high-threat areas, citing a lack of qualified tree-trimming workers. Earlier this month, PG&E issued its first wildfire mitigation plan as part of a new state law. Alsup had told the company he would be weighing that report when determining whether to adjust the probation before the upcoming fire season in June. This month, attorneys Frank Pitre and Steven Campora, at the request of the judge, provided a critical look into PG&E’s troubled wildfire history. “PG&E accepts a high risk of wildfires in its electrical operations and causes significantly more wildfires than other comparable utilities,” the pair, who represent wildfire victims, told Alsup. In June 2017, the attorneys said, PG&E still had more than 6,000 trees near lines that its inspectors had identified as potentially dangerous the year before. However, PG&E said that number was actually 3,962 trees and by the time of the deadly Wine Country fires in October 2017, only 131 were left and none was in the areas of the fire origins. PG&E also clarified troubling emails employees sent five days before the Wine County fires, cited by Pitre and Campora, discussing how work to remove some of those tree hazards had been canceled for the day because they had no line crews available. The utility said that delay was caused by high winds and emphasized the tree in question was several miles away from any of the deadly 2017 fires. Pitre and Campora also compared PG&E’s wildfire record with San Diego Gas & Electric’s. The attorneys said that utility caused 109 wildfires from 2014 to 2017 with only one more than 10 acres. During that same time period, PG&E’s equipment sparked 1,552 wildfires, 68 of them larger than 10 acres, according to the attorneys. PG&E argued that the two utilities are not easily comparable, as the Southern California company has different geography and less dense forests. PG&E said it has 100 million trees near  power lines versus 900,000 in the San Diego utility’s territory. PG&E defended its decision to only start proactive power shutdowns last fire season, saying that after the 2017 Wine Country fires the “calculus” changed. In the filings, PG&E touted its new proposals — as detailed in its wildfire mitigation plan — to add more weather stations, increase vegetation clearance and power shutdowns, and harden its infrastructure, among other short- and long-term projects. “PG&E continues to approach wildfire prevention with the goal of doing all that it can to make sure its facilities do not create public safety risks,” the company wrote Alsup.

Hong Kong\\'s Hang Seng lost 0.6 percent to 28,446.32, while the Shanghai Composite shed 0.4 percent to 2,742.10. Health care and energy companies led U.S. stocks lower. The S&P 500, which has risen for the past three weeks, fell 9.82 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,774.88. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 103.81 points, or 0.4 percent, to 25,850.63. The Nasdaq composite declined 29.36 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,459.71. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gave up 6.11 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,575.55. A mix of recent economic data is fueling concern about a possible global slowdown. The U.S. Labor Department said fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected, an encouraging sign that layoffs are low. Investors are cautious about business conditions going forward as signs of weakness in the global economy emerge. The long-running, costly trade dispute between the U.S. and China has also clouded the outlook. The world\\'s two biggest economies are locked in a trade war after President Donald Trump alleged that China deploys predatory tactics to try to overtake U.S. technological dominance. Beijing\\'s unfair tactics, trade analysts agree, include pressuring American companies to hand over trade secrets and in some cases stealing them outright. The Trump administration has warned it will increase its import taxes on $200 billion in Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent if the two sides haven\\'t reached a resolution by March 2. But Trump in recent days has signaled a willingness to extend the deadline if negotiators are making progress. \"The trade talks do appear to have made some progress, however, but a run of weak data from Japan, Europe and the U.S. yesterday took the wind out of the equity market sails,\" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.

But it’s far from clear that people will embrace a device that retails for almost $2,000, or that it will spark the creative renaissance the smartphone industry apparently needs. The Galaxy Fold, unveiled Wednesday in San Francisco, will sell for $1,980 when it is released April 26. People willing to pay that hefty price will get a device that can unfold like a wallet so it can work like a traditional smartphone with a 4.6 inch screen, or morph into something more like a mini-tablet with a 7.3 inch screen. When fully unfolded, the device will be able to simultaneously run three apps on the screen. “Get ready for the dawn of a new era,” declared DJ Koh, who oversees Samsung’s smartphone division. The new phone, he said, “answers skeptics who said everything has already been done.” Samsung is hoping the Galaxy Fold will spur more people to upgrade their phones and reverse a recent slump that saw its smartphone sales fall 8 percent last year. But some analysts are skeptical. Phones like the Galaxy Fold “are likely to sell to a very limited market of technology aficionados who like big screens and have big wallets,” said IDC analyst Ramon Llamas. Samsung also released new Galaxy S10 phones that boast fancy cameras, sleek screens covering the entire front of the devices, and at least 128 gigabytes of storage — important features to phone shoppers. The S10s are able take wider-angle shots than previous models and can charge other devices, including wireless headphones and smartwatches. A fourth S10 model, due out this spring, will have faster wireless speeds through the emerging 5G cellular network. But those improvements aren’t a big leap from the smartphones released during the past few years by Samsung, Apple and other top manufacturers. With the pace of smartphone innovation seemingly locked in baby steps, most people are holding on to their devices for longer periods than they have in the past. That’s the main reason worldwide smartphone sales dropped 4 percent last year, according to IDC. The reluctance to upgrade has been compounded by smartphone sticker shock, which the Galaxy Fold seems unlikely to alleviate. Samsung is offering a slightly smaller S10 model for $750 in an attempt to make smartphones more affordable, but the higher-end models sell for $900 and $1,000. Two of Samsung’s new models, the S10 and the S10 Plus, are largely incremental upgrades of last year’s S9 and S9 Plus, although they are designed differently. They are about the same size as last year’s models, but will have more display space, as Samsung found additional ways to eliminate waste around the edges. As a byproduct, the top right of the display has a circle or oval cut out for the front-facing cameras. The lowest-priced model, the S10e, has most of the same features, but is 5 percent smaller than the S10. The S10e also lacks curved edges, a signature feature for many Samsung phones. It’s the second time in the past five months that a leading smartphone maker has positioned a $750 phone as a frugal option. Apple priced its cheapest new phone, the iPhone XR, at $750. China’s Huawei and Xiaomi make some smartphones that sell for $500 or less. All three S10 models will come out March 8, and can be ordered starting Thursday. Samsung trumpeted its 10th anniversary lineup ahead of a major mobile device conference in Barcelona next week. Huawei, which is threatening to overtake Apple as the world’s second-biggest seller of smartphones, has promised to use the Spain showcase to preview its device with a foldable screen and the ability to connect to 5G networks as they become operational during the next few years.If anyone knew the ropes about Airbnb rentals, Daniel Rusteen would seem to qualify. He worked for the company as an accountant and later wrote a book for hosts,  “Optimize Your Airbnb.” A leaner vacation-rental market SF short-term rentals transformed as Airbnb, others make peace with city. Under the threat of huge penalties, Airbnb, HomeAway, FlipKey and others have jettisoned hosts who ignored the city’s registration requirement But despite being steeped in all things Airbnb, Rusteen said he didn’t realize that he and his roommates were supposed to register when they rented out a sofa in their North Beach apartment to Airbnb travelers from 2014 to 2016. They used the money for utilities. “It was all kind of hazy, the whole process,” he said. “We just figured, ‘Okay, we’re just doing a couch. This thing is to keep housing on the market, and we’re not kicking out tenants.’” The city got wind of the couch rental last year and slapped him with a fine of several hundred dollars, which he considered “ludicrous.” He now travels the world, staying in Airbnbs and running his businesses. Rusteen’s story isn’t unique. Many hosts claimed ignorance of the registration rule. Others said it was too cumbersome. Others chose to defy it. San Francisco worked closely with Airbnb on a  pioneering vacation-rental law  requiring all local hosts to register starting in February 2015. The city wanted to make sure that only permanent residents rent to tourists, so landlords don’t turn vacant apartments into lucrative ad hoc hotels. By getting hosts to register, it can verify that they are permanent residents and require them to report on how often they rent to tourists. But only a fraction of hosts registered. That left the city playing cat-and-mouse games to track down illegal operators. In frustration, San Francisco supervisors got tough. They  passed a law  to levy steep fines and criminal penalties on websites that brokered rentals in unregistered units. Airbnb and HomeAway  sued  — and essentially lost. A  judge ordered  them to  work with the city on a registration system.  Their agreement included a phase-in to jettison unregistered hosts over the months from September until Jan. 16.

Email:  csaid@sfchronicle.com  Twitter:  @csaidChampagne Louis Roederer, the French company famous for producing Cristal Champagne, has agreed to purchase Merry Edwards Winery in Sebastopol, a highly regarded producer of Pinot Noir, from Merry Edwards and her husband Ken Coopersmith. The deal, which includes the Merry Edwards brand, inventory, winery and 45 acres of vineyard land, marks Roederer’s first foray into Sonoma County. The purchase price was not disclosed. “I met with a lot of companies, and when I met with Roederer, we were instantly at ease with each other,” said Merry Edwards, who started her eponymous company 22 years ago. Roederer owns three properties in Mendocino County: Roederer Estate, Scharffenberger Cellars and Domaine Anderson, in addition to wineries in France and Portugal including Domaines Ott, Chateau Pichon-Longueville Comtesse de Lalande, Ramos Pinto, Delas Freres and Champagne Louis Roederer. Frédéric Rouzaud, president of Roederer, said that Merry Edwards’ distinguished record with Sonoma County Pinot Noir had first attracted him. Pinot is a growing focus for Roederer; the company built Domaine Anderson in 2012 in order to grow that segment of its portfolio. But it was Edwards’ story, and “the fact that she built her winery from scratch,” Rouzaud said, that sealed the deal. “We had looked at Kosta Browne,” he said — another high-profile Sonoma Pinot brand, which  sold last year to Duckhorn  after a string of private equity investments and was no longer under the control of its founders. The importance of working with family-owned wineries, Rouzaud said, “is something we cannot really explain or measure.” As for Edwards’ decision to sell, she said it was simple. “I’m turning 72 this year,” she said. “How am I going to carry this forward?” Her son and daughter became involved in the winery about 10 years ago, but both ultimately left to focus on pursuits outside of the wine industry. That left Edwards to face the same questions that many of her peers have had to face — like Calera founder Josh Jensen, who  sold his brand to Duckhorn  a year before the Kosta Browne deal. “I have a lot of energy now, but what if something happens?” said Edwards. “I have 28 employees. Do I want to wait until something happens?” The deal with Roederer has been in the works for a year and a half, Edwards said. Throughout the process of searching for a buyer, she remained wary. “What’s so common today is big companies come in and buy properties like ours, then they just ruin them,” she said. She was encouraged by Roederer’s “history of taking small properties and building them, but not losing their individual flavor.” Today, Merry Edwards Winery is widely understood to be one of Sonoma County’s great Pinot Noir producers. But the winery is merely the culmination of a long and varied career in which Edwards broke through gender barriers and made scientific discoveries that proved crucial for the California wine industry. She earned her master’s degree in food science, with an emphasis in enology, from UC Davis in 1973 — one of just three women in her program, and the only woman who would go on to become a winemaker. She immediately landed an enviable job, as head winemaker at Mount Eden Vineyards in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and later went on to help launch Matanzas Creek in Sonoma County. For her master’s thesis, Edwards tested 120 wines that had been bottled with lead capsules over their corks, and discovered widespread lead contamination in the wines. That groundbreaking research would help eliminate lead capsules from California wines. Edwards’ other major scientific contribution to the wine industry was related to clones — distinctive selections of a single grape variety. In the 1970s, grapevine clones were poorly understood in California. But on a trip to Burgundy, Edwards learned that the University of Dijon was undertaking extensive research to learn how different clones of Pinot Noir behaved in the vineyard. “I was completely blown away,” Edwards said. “By golly, these clones had completely different qualities.” The 25-year-old Pinot Noir vines at Mount Eden, she figured, were as distinctive and beautiful as any. Could those vines produce an isolated clone? In 1975, Edwards took a vine cutting and sent it off to the UC Davis nursery for quarantine. The resulting plant material, officially known as UCD Clone 37, is now often called the Mount Eden clone, or the Merry Edwards clone — and is responsible for much of the high-quality Pinot Noir planted throughout California. “I feel like it’s my gift,” Edwards said of Clone 37. “It’s virus free. It makes this incredible wine. I was really lucky to find that and be able to clean it up.” Merry Edwards Winery was not the winemaker’s original business venture. In the 1980s, she went into business with her parents on a brand called the Merry Vintners. Each year’s wine labels featured an illustration of a different type of microbe. It was a financial disaster, Edwards said. Her family sold the brand to DeLoach Vineyards, and her second time around, with Merry Edwards Winery, “we had learned to do everything the complete opposite,” she laughed. She launched that eponymous winery in 1997, a year after Edwards bought a 25-acre vineyard in Sebastopol, which would become her Meredith Estate. The company’s land holdings expanded throughout Sonoma County over the subsequent years, and in 2006, after years of making the wines in custom-crush facilities, Edwards built a new winery in the middle of her Coopersmith Vineyard. Just four years later, she undertook a major renovation of the winery. Famously, Merry Edwards Winery has always offered free tastings. When asked whether that will change under Roederer’s ownership, Rouzaud laughed; he was not aware of the policy. “But no, that will not change,” he said. The Merry Edwards Winery staff is expected to remain on board, including Heidi von der Mehden, who was named head winemaker last year. Von der Mehden’s hiring, in 2015, was the first step in the succession plan, Edwards said: “We had a very clear three-year plan for Heidi to become winemaker.” According to the agreement, Edwards will continue to work at the winery for at least a year. “And then we’ll play it by ear,” she said. She has two young grandchildren now. Her priorities have shifted. “This has been our life — it’s been our passion,” she said. “But the point is: One has to be realistic.” Should we expect more California acquisitions by Roederer in the coming years? “Why not?” Rouzaud replied. “We never close the door.”WASHINGTON — After nearly  two years  of delays, the Trump administration is moving ahead with its plan to  stop granting work permits  to the spouses of many high-skilled visa holders, an effort that could jeopardize tens of thousands of immigrant families in California alone. Rolling back the permits could have sweeping consequences for the Bay Area, where tech companies heavily rely on high-skilled immigrants. Many of those workers come to the U.S. with spouses and children, and the loss of the spousal work permits could imperil families’ ability to stay in the country or deter workers from accepting jobs here to begin with. The step forward for the regulation comes as a federal appeals court ran out of patience with the administration’s delays in issuing it. The proposed regulation was officially sent to the White House for review on Wednesday, a government database shows. That procedural step means that the Department of Homeland Security has completed its work on the policy. The White House will now put the regulation through review with other agencies, a process that can take anywhere from days to months, depending on the regulation’s complexity. At issue are work permits for nearly 100,000 immigrants who are here with spouses, working on high-tech visas and seeking green cards. (Spouses and children of H-1B visa holders have H-4 visas granting residence.) The largest share of those, nearly 30,000 of them, live in California, according to a Congressional Research Service  report. In 2015, the Obama administration created the H-4 employment authorization document, known as H-4 EAD, to allow those spouses to work until the family can get green cards. Getting those permanent residency permits can often take many years, especially for immigrants of countries like India and China that send a lot of high-skilled talent to the U.S. In the meantime, their spouses are unable to work legally in the U.S. unless they have an employer who can separately sponsor them for a visa. Since it went into effect,  more than 90,000  immigrants have been approved for work permits under the program. President Trump pledged early on to rescind the H-4 permit program, but the administration has  delayed. As it continued to promise the regulation would come, a lawsuit challenging the program has been on hold in the courts. That changed in December, when the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals stopped granting the Department of Homeland Security extensions and ordered that the case proceed. A group of technology workers called Save Jobs USA who argue the program jeopardizes American jobs sued the Obama administration and, after losing in D.C. federal court, appealed the case. The Trump administration after taking power had it postponed until December. The reasons for the delay, and sudden step forward, are not entirely clear. Government lawyers had assured the court the rule was being written and reviewed. In September, the lawyers had predicted a rule would be out in three months. The first briefs in the case are due in March. Experts suspect that with the government finishing  a separate rule blocking immigrants who might use public benefits,  and with the lawsuit moving forward, the work was expedited. Once the rule is published, the government could argue the court should indefinitely postpone the lawsuit, as the underlying regulation is being rewritten. That would avoid the chance that the appellate court decides the program is legal, setting a precedent contrary to the objectives of the Trump administration. “The agency doesn’t want to risk having a judicial ruling that would go against it,” said Natalie Tynan, an attorney with Hunton Andrews Kurth who worked in the Department of Homeland Security for  more than 11 years. “In general from an agency’s perspective, the agency prefers to issue its regulations rather than have the courts opine on what the regulations should say. So any opportunity to moot out litigation is a positive one for the agency.” Fifteen members of California’s congressional delegation  signed a letter  urging the Trump administration to preserve the permit program last year. They included Reps. Anna Eshoo, D-Palo Alto, Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose and Ro Khanna, D-Fremont. Eshoo and Lofgren introduced legislation late last year to keep the H-4 spousal work permit program in place. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency within Homeland Security that manages the program, is “committed to upholding our nation’s immigration laws, helping ensure they are faithfully carried out, and safeguarding the integrity of our immigration system designed to protect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers,” according to spokeswoman Jessica Collins. She would not comment on the substance of the regulation, but noted it’s not final until the review and comment  process is complete. Once the White House signs off on the draft regulation, it will be published in the Federal Register. That will start a clock on a comment period, usually 30 to 90 days, after which the administration legally has to review the comments and make any necessary revisions. Only after that can the regulation be finalized, and litigation could potentially hold it up for months or years longer. Still, the uncertainty of future job status and symbolism of the Trump administration proposal could have immediate ripple effects for families that rely on the visas, and companies struggling to attract top talent. “If you have 100,000 people who are extremely well-educated, and on the path to getting green cards, and are either indirectly stimulating economic growth or directly creating jobs for native-born Americans by starting companies in this country, why would you pull out the rug from all these people?” said Doug Rand, co-founder of Boundless, a tech startup designed to help immigrants navigate the legal system. Rand also worked on the original H-4 regulation in the Obama administration. Rand pointed out that only families already approved for green cards qualify for the work visa, meaning the government has already determined there are no Americans who could be working the high-skilled job. Once approved, they still must wait for the green card to be issued, and the spouses need the H-4 work permit because of the  lengthy processing backlog  for people from some countries, including India. Until they actually receive their green cards, they remain ineligible to work.  Lofgren has co-authored legislation to eliminate per-country green card caps, shortening the wait. John Miano, the attorney representing Save Jobs USA, said the focus should be on American workers, and argued that the Obama administration overstepped its legal authority to create the work permit without explicit congressional action. “Why are congressmen creating regulations to protect the jobs of foreign workers when they have done nothing to advance legislation to prevent Americans from being replaced by H-1B workers?” Miano said. He added that the high-skilled visas have requirements that spousal work authorizations lack, including proving that Americans could not fill the jobs they are taking. More than 93 percent of those affected by the potential removal of the work permit are women, which especially concerns advocates. “It undermines the agency and dignity of these spouses and it harms their career prospects; it leaves them less empowered to leave abusive situations,” said Amanda Baran, an attorney and advocate with the San Francisco-based Immigrant Legal Resource Center and a veteran of the Department of Homeland Security. “I feel like it’s just another part of Trump’s larger agenda, which is to expel immigrants, prevent them from coming in and make life uncomfortable for them here and compel them to leave,” she said.In 2001, this Russian Hill home sold for $740,000. Today, with an extensive remodel that both modernizes and preserves the best of its original 1920s features, the price is $3.495 million. The home Inside the 2,615 square feet are three bedrooms, three bathrooms, a living room, a family room, a rather stunning kitchen, plus temperature-controlled wine storage for 900 bottles. From the entry, the original curved doorway and mahogany wood staircase echo details of the home\\'s 1924 genesis. Up those stairs to the main level is a dining room with high exposed-beam ceilings, a bar nook with wine storage, and fridge. That same beamed ceiling arches over the living room with its west-facing windows, built-ins, and wood-burning fireplace. Though original details abound, the results of a high-end renovation cannot be missed, particularly in the kitchen: Top-of-the-line Miele appliances (including an espresso machine), gas range with griddle, built-in combination steam oven, and custom walnut cabinetry are just a few new features. The warm wood patina of these cabinets plays off\\xa0 the quartzite countertops and mosaic tile backsplash. The larger of two sinks faces a living wall of succulents. Off the kitchen is a home office, featuring a redwood built-in desk. Also on this floor is a bathroom featuring radiant floor heating and a bedroom with over-size closet and backyard view, as well as the 900-bottle wine storage. Next to this wine storage is access to the garden with both covered and uncovered patio. Upstairs are a master suite that takes up the entire width of the home. On this level also is an additional family room with built-in wet bar/kitchenette. The property The location of this home, 2424 Larkin St., means all the amenities of Polk and Hyde Streets are just a short walk from your doorstep. But despite such a central Russian Hill location, there\\'s a sense of privacy and peace afforded by the sizable backyard--landscaped and terraced--with two landings for enjoying the outdoors. A huge garage that can accommodate up to four cars in tandem offers a sink, freezer, and storage.

Marine ExchangeCardioDx, the defunct Redwood City company that  shut down abruptly  in January after Medicare rescinded coverage of its flagship blood test, has formally entered a process similar to bankruptcy to shed remaining assets and pay out creditors. The company, founded in 2003, made a blood test meant to help doctors diagnose heart disease. It sold millions of dollars worth of the test over the course of six years — mostly to the federal government’s Medicare insurance program for seniors — until Medicare in late 2018 stopped paying for the test because it was found to be of little use to patients. Around the same time, the U.S. Department of Justice was reviewing whistle-blower claims brought by two former CardioDx employees who accused the company and top executives of defrauding Medicare and U.S. taxpayers out of millions of dollars by knowingly selling an unnecessary test. The agency in November decided not to pursue the claims, but one of the whistle-blower lawsuits remains ongoing. About 175,000 patients have used the test, according to company estimates. CardioDx did not respond to a request for comment. The quasi-bankruptcy process, known as assignment for the benefit of creditors, is governed by state rather than federal bankruptcy law, but the outcome is the same. Smaller companies that have few remaining assets often pursue this route because it is less expensive than federal Bankruptcy Court, said Jared Ellias, a bankruptcy law professor at UC Hastings. Meanwhile, CardioDx founder and Chief Strategy Officer David Levison has denied the allegations of fraud contained in the whistle-blower lawsuit, according to a court document jointly filed by the attorneys representing all the parties in the suit. Levison’s attorney did not return calls and emails requesting comment. A second CardioDx manager named in the same suit disputes the whistle-blower’s claims he was fired for bringing up concerns about the test to executives, saying instead that the employee was fired for pressuring his team to deploy unethical sales tactics. In its final days, CardioDx laid off 110 employees, according to a notice the company filed with the state Employment Development Department in December. It is unclear how much in remaining assets CardioDx has or who its largest creditors are. But some of the company’s equipment, including freezers, centrifuges and liquid handlers, will be auctioned off beginning in March, according to the firm that is handling the auction. The blood test in question, called the Corus test, was CardioDx’s only product. It was intended to be used in cases of chest discomfort to rule out if a patient needed further testing for coronary artery disease. But CardioDx “failed to demonstrate that testing resulted in improved patient outcomes or that testing changed physician management to result in improved patient outcomes,” said one notice from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that ended the program’s coverage of the test. It is unclear how much Medicare spent on the test during the six years it covered it, how much in payments CardioDx collected, or how much may have been paid for out of pocket by patients. But in 2016 and 2017 alone, the Medicare program and patients collectively spent nearly $52 million on the test, according to a Chronicle analysis of data from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. CardioDx was once a promising Silicon Valley startup that attracted venture funding from Kleiner Perkins and Intel Capital. The company had raised $297 million in funding, with its most recent round for $22.5 million in 2017.To meet its aggressive goals for fighting climate change, California wants to wean millions of homes and businesses in the state off natural gas. And the efforts appear to be intensifying this year as state leaders turn more of their environmental attention to the buildings sector, the state’s second-largest source of planet-warming emissions after transportation. The California Public Utilities Commission recently began developing new programs to help eliminate carbon use in buildings, under a mandate from a law passed last year. At the same time, a policy report being considered for adoption Wednesday by the California Energy Commission highlights the importance of addressing greenhouse gas emissions from buildings. It outlines strategies such as the electrification of space and water heaters. Fossil fuels such as natural gas, when used to heat and light buildings, pump carbon into the air, while renewable energy sources do not. A new coalition that includes some of the state’s utilities, local governments, environmental organizations and others with a stake in the efforts has begun publicly advocating for more action to address pollution from buildings. That new group, the Building Decarbonization Coalition, recently introduced a policy “road map” for the state’s homes and businesses to go carbon-neutral by 2045,  the same year  the state is trying to be relying entirely on renewable energy. Members of the coalition include Southern California Edison, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the city of Oakland, the Sierra Club and the Environmental Defense Fund, among others. Pacific Gas and Electric Co., which is reportedly considering a sale of its gas business, is not a member. “PG&E supports California’s greenhouse gas reduction goals and recognizes the significant role we can play in accelerating the decarbonization of the building and transportation sectors,” PG&E spokeswoman Lynsey Paulo said in a statement. “To that end, we’ve participated in meetings with the Building Decarbonization Coalition.” The utility has provided the coalition feedback on its policy proposals, she said. “The reality is, we’re not going to meet our climate goals if we continue to burn gas in buildings. Full stop,” said Panama Bartholomy, the director of the coalition. “Every building that we build is just digging the hole deeper.” The group recommends California adopt a “zero emission building code” for homes by 2025 and businesses by 2028 as it tries to reduce the building sector’s greenhouse gas emissions 20 percent by 2025 and 40 percent by 2030. Sales of high-efficiency space heat pumps should grow from 5 percent of sales to 50 percent in 2025, and for water heaters they should grow from 1 percent to 50 percent in the same time as both strive to reach 100 percent of all sales by 2030, the road map envisions. “The beauty here is, in the time frame we’re talking about — now and 2045 — every single one of your water heaters is going to break and every single one of your furnaces is going to break,” Bartholomy said. “Now it’s a matter of, how do we create a market environment where it’s going to make more sense for people to go electric when it breaks rather than keep going on gas?” The coalition says its ultimate goal is to make every home in California fully reliant on electricity for its energy needs, recognizing that the state has already made significant strides in getting its electricity from more renewable sources and will continue to make progress on that front. Coalition members are also trying to keep equity in mind. “We’ve already decarbonized the electricity sector a lot,” said Stephanie Wang, policy director of the California Housing Partnership, which is part of the coalition. “We know we’re going to need to really quickly start working on reducing the emissions in how we heat our homes and our water, but how we do it is really important.” Wang said the state can’t let its efforts fall to the whims of the market, or it will risk letting all the benefits fall to higher-income “early adopters” who can afford pricey new technology. So the coalition will work to support technologies that are affordable to more than just the very wealthy, she said. California’s high electricity costs create another financial challenge toward shifting homes off natural gas that could be changed if the state changes its approach, said Severin Borenstein, a UC Berkeley energy economist. “It will not be very attractive, from a household point of view, if we still keep charging astronomical electricity prices,” Borenstein said of wiping out gas use in homes. “But those electricity prices don’t represent the real cost of generating electricity.” If California came up with a way to price electricity “at a rate that reflects its true cost,” the state could clearly cost-effectively heat water without needing gas and “space heating would not be far behind,” Borenstein said. While the state moves to eventually get away from natural gas entirely, environmental groups are also pushing regulators to make the current system as climate-friendly as possible. One of the issues in a regulatory proceeding the state utilities commission opened in 2015 is whether California utilities should continue the long-standing practice of charging their customers for the cost of gas lost to the atmosphere via leaky pipes and other means. The Environmental Defense Fund is pushing to end the practice and was recently backed up in a letter of support from several environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, Environment California and the California League of Conservation Voters. The groups estimate that, over the past three years, utilities have received more than $55 million from customers to pay for avoidable gas leaks that could heave heated nearly 200,000 homes for one year. Preventing utilities from using rates to cover the costs of leaks could give them an incentive to make more technological upgrades, said Tim O’Connor, senior director of the environmental fund’s California energy program. “The utilities have demonstrated that they ... have not always gone as far as the technology shows is possible, and the (Public Utilities Commission) has also shown they’re deferring to utilities in terms of what kind of technology they can use,” O’Connor said. “The only incentive right now is to do the bare minimum that’s required under law.” The groups also want to set a precedent that could be replicated in other states that may not have the will or the means to pursue more aggressive energy measures, O’Connor said. “We need to make it as environmentally benign as possible while we’re also making the new system that we want,” he said.After lurching from crisis to crisis last year, Tesla appeared to have found its footing in January when it reported its second consecutive quarterly profit and said it had more than enough cash to pay off bonds coming due in March. The calm did not last. This week, Tesla said its general counsel was leaving the job after just two months. It was the second unexpected departure of a high-level executive in less than a month and one of dozens in the last three years. The general counsel, Dane Butswinkas, was a prominent Washington trial lawyer who represented CEO Elon Musk when he was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission last year over claims that he had secured funding to take the company private. Tesla said Butswinkas had decided to return to his law firm and would be replaced by Jonathan Chang, a vice president in its legal department. On Jan. 30, Musk surprised analysts on a conference call by announcing that Tesla’s chief financial officer, Deepak Ahuja, would retire without saying exactly when. Last year, the chief accounting officer, David Morton, stepped down after just a month on the job. Morton’s predecessor, Eric Branderiz, left after 14 months. All told, Tesla has lost more than 40 senior executives since the beginning of 2016, according to a list compiled by Reuters. Butswinkas’ departure was all the more noteworthy because it came less than 24 hours after Musk made an ambitious prediction on Twitter about the company’s production goals, an action that raised questions about his compliance with the settlement that he and Tesla reached with the SEC. Musk said that he expected the company to produce 500,000 cars this year — 100,000 more than he had forecast just three weeks earlier. Four hours later, Musk said he had misspoken. In the settlement with the SEC, he and Tesla had agreed that it would put in place “mandatory procedures to oversee and preapprove Mr. Musk’s Tesla-related written communications” that might have material information. A Tesla spokesman declined to comment on what scrutiny had been given to Musk’s incorrect statement before it was posted. The SEC’s securities fraud case stemmed from a Twitter post in August in which Musk said he planned to take the company private at $420 per share and had “funding secured.” In addition to the condition about reviewing his statements, Musk agreed to step down as chairman; he and the company each paid penalties of $20 million; and the company added two new independent directors. “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the general counsel is leaving after a tweet that appears to violate the agreement,” said Rebecca Lindland, executive editor of the auto industry and car review website RebeccaDrives. “It calls into question the oversight of the board and the adherence to the SEC settlement.” The SEC and the Justice Department have been looking into whether Musk misled investors about its production goals. Musk had once predicted that Tesla would make 500,000 cars in 2018. The company actually made about 245,000 cars last year. Tesla said in a securities filing this week that it “will continue to cooperate with government authorities.” The stream of executive departures is one of several challenges for Tesla. It is scrambling to secure financing to build a plant in China, one that Musk has vowed would begin churning out cars by the end of this year. Sales of its two most profitable models, the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X SUV, are flat. And it is still unable to produce a $35,000 version of the Model 3 sedan, which many customers are holding out for. Next month, Tesla has to pay bondholders $920 million, which would consume about a quarter of the $3.7 billion it had in cash at the end of December. The company’s stock closed down 1 percent Wednesday and fell farther on Thursday before rising by 1 percent on Friday. Tesla’s sales appear to have dropped off markedly since the beginning of the year, when a federal tax credit available to Tesla customers was cut in half, to $3,750. An online publication that follows Tesla closely, InsideEVs, has estimated that the company sold 6,500 cars in January, a 75 percent drop from the final months of 2018, when buyers could still take advantage of the full tax credit. Tesla has declined to comment on the estimate, but customer traffic appears to have dropped off significantly at its showrooms. On Saturday afternoon, a saleswoman at a company store near Pittsburgh showed a customer a Model 3 while six other employees stood idly by. While more than 50 Teslas were parked in the back, just two cars were parked in spots reserved for prospective buyers. In addition, as production and sales have increased, so have complaints about quality and customer service. Many customers have had to wait months to have their cars repaired because of shortages of replacement parts.Nestlé, Epic Games and other major brands said they had stopped buying advertisements on YouTube after their ads appeared on children’s videos where pedophiles had infiltrated the comment sections. The companies acted after a YouTube user posted a video this week to point out this behavior. For the most part, the videos targeted by pedophiles did not violate YouTube’s rules and were innocent enough — young girls doing gymnastics, playing Twister or stretching — but the videos became overrun with suggestive remarks directed at the children. The commenters left time stamps for parts of the video that can appear compromising when paused — like a girl’s backside or bare legs. They also posted remarks that praised the girls, asked whether they were wearing underwear, or simply carried a string of sexually suggestive emoji. About two years ago, hundreds of companies pulled money from YouTube over concerns about ads showing up next to problematic content from terror or hate groups and videos that seemed to endanger or exploit children. Over the last year, many major advertisers have returned to the site after they were reassured that YouTube had made progress in flagging and dealing with problematic content more quickly. The video highlighting the comments, posted by YouTube creator Matt Watson (also known as MattsWhatItIs) and viewed 1.75 million times since it went up on Sunday, accused YouTube of “facilitating the sexual exploitation” of children. Watson said YouTube’s recommendation system also guided predators to other similar videos of minors — many of which carry advertisements for major brands. Chi Hea Cho, a spokeswoman for YouTube’s parent company, Google, said it had deleted the accounts and channels of people leaving the disturbing comments, deleted comments that violate its policies and reported illegal activity to the authorities. “Any content — including comments — that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube,” Cho said. “There’s more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly.” Many of the advertisers identified in the video and in a subsequent report by Wired — Epic Games, GNC and Nestlé’s companies in the United States — said they had suspended advertising on YouTube. Bloomberg News reported that the Walt Disney Co. also halted ads but the company didn’t respond to requests for comment Wednesday. “When we learned of this issue, we were — and still are — absolutely horrified and reached out to YouTube to rectify this immediately,” Senka Hadzimuratovic, a spokeswoman for the online grammar tool Grammarly, said in an email. “We have a strict policy against advertising alongside harmful or offensive content and would never knowingly associate ourselves with channels like this. It goes against everything our company stands for.” In response to the latest concerns, Cho said, YouTube disabled comments on tens of millions of videos featuring minors and removed thousands of inappropriate comments on videos with young people in them. She said YouTube had also terminated over 400 YouTube channels for comments that they left on videos and reported illegal comments to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. YouTube has struggled to police children’s content. In late 2017, the New York Times found that disturbing content was showing up in YouTube’s children’s app, which is meant for users under 13. Videos depicted the deaths of beloved cartoon characters and real children in distressing situations. There have been earlier reports of pedophiles cruising YouTube for videos of minors and leaving lewd or sexual comments. In response, YouTube said in 2017 that it would do more to “protect families,” pledging to remove videos that endanger children and block inappropriate comments on content featuring minors. “There are some real questions at this point on whether YouTube is just too big to provide a safe place for children,” said Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. “If you can’t keep pedophiles from trading information in your comment sections of your videos, then you shouldn’t have comment sections of your videos,” Golin said. “It’s a legitimate question to ask — what are the value of YouTube comments, besides to Google’s bottom line, that’s worth the horribleness that occurs there?” While YouTube has said it deletes hundreds of millions of comments every quarter that violate its guidelines, the lewd remarks on otherwise innocent videos were not flagged. Watson, the maker of the original video, has come under fire from some fellow YouTube users, who accused him of starting another “adpocalypse” — what video creators called the plunge in ad revenue from the boycott in 2017 — by shedding light on the issue. Those critics have said in separate videos online that Watson should have reported the alleged pedophiles through YouTube’s own tools, rather than draw media and advertiser attention to the matter and risk costing them revenue.Israel is heading to the moon. And if it’s successful, the small nation of about 9 million will only be the fourth to successfully deliver a robotic lander to the lunar surface — after the heavyweights of China, Russia and the United States. The mission has been long and the road arduous for Israeli nonprofit SpaceIL, which has, in some iteration or another, been working on the concept of a lunar lander for nearly a decade. Now, that work culminates Thursday when a SpaceX Falcon 9 is scheduled to launch from complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station with SpaceIL’s lander in tow. There is a 32-minute nighttime launch window. From the beginning, the goal for SpaceIL was to induce an “Apollo effect,” capturing the imaginations of the next generation of scientists in Israel, and encouraging kids to enter into the fields of science, engineering, technology and math, much like the Apollo missions in the United States did in the 1960s. “This mission is a source of inspiration for people around the world, and we are looking forward to making history and watching as the Israeli flag joins superpowers Russia, China and the United States on (the) moon,” said philanthropist and businessman Morris Kahn, SpaceIL’s president, who has contributed $40 million in financing to the project. SpaceIL’s mission began in earnest in 2009, when founders Yariv Bash, Kfir Damari and Yonatan Winetraub registered for Google’s Lunar X Prize — a moon race to build and land a commercial lunar spacecraft. The first competitors to do it would win a $20 million first-place prize. They founded SpaceIL in 2011, and in 2015 scored a launch contract with SpaceX. SpaceIL was later named one of five finalists for the prize, along with Cape Canaveral’s Moon Express. But as the competition wore on, it became apparent that none of the companies were going to be able to meet the deadline to land on the moon, and so Google ultimately scrapped the competition in March 2018. But SpaceIL and partner Israel Aerospace Industries pushed ahead, surviving financial challenges to complete the lander. In addition to Kahn, Dr. Miriam Adelson, an Israeli-American doctor and philanthropist, and her husband, casino magnate and investor Sheldon Adelson, have contributed $24 million to keep the lunar lander soaring. “It is high time that the Jewish people and the State of Israel achieved this immortal milestone,” the Adelsons said in a news release. “In religion and ethics, science and scholarship, we have long reached for the stars; now we are rightfully reaching the moon.” In honor of that milestone, SpaceIL named the $100 million spacecraft Beresheet, Hebrew for “in the beginning.” It’s small, weighing about 350 pounds without fuel and standing about 5 feet tall and 6½ feet wide. And it still has a complicated journey ahead. The SpaceX mission, which has other payloads onboard, is highly complex. About 30 minutes after the launch, when the rocket is about 37,000 miles from Earth’s surface, Beresheet will disengage from the Falcon 9. The trip to the moon will take about two months, with the craft gradually orbiting Earth in larger ellipticals until it’s close enough to the moon that it can ignite its engines and reduce its speed to be picked up by the moon’s gravity. Scientists at Israel Aerospace Industries’ facility in Yehud, Israel — about 10 miles southeast of Tel Aviv — will be in charge of sending data to the autonomous craft as it performs each maneuver in its lengthy journey. The landing itself, though, will be in the hands of Beresheet. The team in Israel will not be able to control the lander as it makes its 20-minute descent onto the lunar surface on April 11. But if all goes well, the lander will spend some time on the moon’s Sea of Tranquility, taking photos of the surface and measuring the magnetic field at its landing site. And that’s where it will stay — until someday, perhaps, Israeli astronauts can retrieve it. Stored inside is a totem to the nation: A time capsule in the form of three disks containing Israeli artifacts such as its Proclamation of Independence, national songs and drawings by Israeli children. “At SpaceIL we hope that the next generation of engineers and scientists will be able to bring Beresheet back to Earth,” the company said. Despite its historical significance, Beresheet is not the primary payload on the journey. In a ride-share agreement arranged by mission management company Spaceflight, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 will also be shuttling a telecommunications satellite for the South East Asia region built by SSL in Palo Alto. The Indonesian Nusantara Satu satellite will provide data, internet and video connection throughout Indonesia. A second small satellite for the U.S. Air Force Research Lab called S5 will also go to geosynchronous transfer orbit with a mission to test space situational awareness technologies. After Beresheet detaches from the Falcon 9, the two stilettos will head to geostationary orbit, with the Air Force satellite detaching before they reach their final position. The weather is looking good for the Thursday night launch attempt. According to the Air Force’s 45th Weather Squadron, weather is 80 percent “go” for launches on Thursday or Friday, in the case of a scrub. On both days, the biggest worry is a thick layer of clouds. The launch will be live-streamed by SpaceX on YouTube and by SpaceIL on Facebook.Despite his penchant for building multimillion-dollar dream estates, Lowell Strauss likes to keep a low profile. The business he runs with his wife, Jacqueline, Amalfi West, has no website, and Strauss sidesteps social media. “In a past life, I was a software architect, so I am supposed to love technology,” he said. “The truth is I don’t. I would prefer to live a more holistic life without social media and the like.” Strauss hails from Waterloo, an Ontario town about 90 minutes from Toronto. He worked in construction during high school and college and grew up in a house his father designed. Strauss’ father ultimately became a commercial real estate developer and builder, after dropping out of high school to run his parent’s press shop. “I have an appreciation of design and architecture in my blood,” Strauss said. “And my wife is multitalented and we really complement each other when we do one of these projects.” Details:  Builder/developer of high-end estates along the California coast. Portfolio includes 10 Margarita Drive in San Rafael; 9 Woodside Way in Ross and 460 Ridge Road in Tiburon. Owned by Lowell and Jacqueline Strauss, the firm’s next project, 135 Belvedere Ave. in Tiburon, is a $65 million estate with more than 12,000 square feet of living space, a private pier and sweeping views from the Golden Gate Bridge to downtown San Francisco. The Strausses also operate Oceanfront Retreats, a separate but related business focused on vacation rental properties. That connection to nature and the elements drives his design philosophy. He credits this appreciation to his interactions with the Anishinaabe and Ojibwe, indigenous peoples found in Northwestern Ontario. “When I was younger, I spent months each year planting trees and living deep in the northwestern Ontario wilderness. I lived in a tent, and worked alongside native people, who had this otherworldly contentedness to nature. Indigenous people have a connection to the Earth that we have lost,” he said. “It may sound ridiculous, a guy building multimillion-dollar homes talking about these things, but this is what inspires my wife and I.” In this interview with The Chronicle, Strauss talks about how he and his wife select building sites, the biggest hurdles he faces and an engineering advancement that’s fundamentally changed the way they design. Q:  How do you select sites for development? A:  We invest in real estate all along the coast. We look for unique and spectacular natural settings. We are very selective about the properties we purchase. Every property has to speak to us for some reason or another. We trend toward spectacular views, oceanfront homes or land with a natural element that sets them apart. Topography is very important since we look for sites that allow for indoor/outdoor living. Having the topography that allows for easy access to the outdoors without much effort but still allows for privacy, expansive outdoor spaces and best views is very challenging. Q:  What’s the most challenging part of your job? A:  Usually it’s the design review process, and sometimes dealing with unfriendly neighbors. It’s very hard not to take it personally when you are so passionate about what you are doing. I mean, yes, we are developers and are out to make a profit, but that is not what drives our process. We don’t even think about budget when we design something. We think about creating the greatest thing we can imagine, and an integral part of that is how that thing fits into the natural environment. I think our work in the end speaks for itself. For us, leaving something magnificent behind, that people can walk past, and it really makes them happy, just like when you first look at a magnificent piece of art, that’s everything to us. Q:  How do you go about selecting fits and finishes for a home? A:  The materials must serve a purpose in terms of how we want a particular space to feel. Every room in our houses has something special about it. We try and always use natural materials like stone, wood, steel or concrete to speak to that. Stone, to me, is very emotional. We once took slabs of fossilized boulders from an ancient landslide and sandblasted them. We used them to panel the walls of a bathroom and it created this incredible three-dimensional effect that people really responded to. Our Belvedere project has these incredible indoor/outdoor spas in some of the key bathrooms, and will be made from stone slabs with a leathered finish, which will make sitting in them feel soft, sexy and supple. Q:  What enables you to have such substantial indoor/outdoor living designs? A:  We spend a lot of time researching the glazing of the windows and doors we use. We want massive openings, with transparent minimalistic frames, that allow us to literally have walls of glass that make the building feel sheltered, yet transparent. The selection of this type of window and door system has really taken us to the pinnacle of architecture and design. There are incredibly expensive products out there that let you achieve incredible feats of engineering while providing the structural rigidity that is required for such massive open spaces.WASHINGTON — More than a dozen children’s advocacy groups have accused Facebook of knowingly deceiving children into racking up fees from games on its social network, the latest in a string of complaints against the Menlo Park company sent to federal regulators. The groups called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether Facebook violated consumer protection and child privacy laws by duping children into making in-app purchases in games like “Angry Birds,” “PetVille” and “Ninja Saga,” and then making it nearly impossible for children or their parents to seek refunds. The accusation stems from a 2012 lawsuit. The complaint, filed Thursday by 17 groups including Common Sense Media of San Francisco, Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood and the Center for Digital Democracy, says the purchases were often done without a parent’s permission. In some cases, they amounted to thousands of dollars. “Facebook’s exploitative practices targeted a population universally recognized as vulnerable — young people,” the groups said in the complaint. In Washington’s greater focus on the power of Big Tech, Facebook has taken center stage. The company’s role in state-sponsored election interference, harmful content and privacy violations has set off a push for new privacy laws and multiple investigations of the company. Next week, Congress will debate proposals for a federal privacy law. The FTC started investigating Facebook in March after the New York Times reported that the data of tens of millions of Facebook users was unknowingly shared with political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The agency is in the final stages of that investigation, with staff members and Facebook negotiating over a potential settlement that could include a multibillion-dollar fine and new restraints on the company’s business practices, according to people familiar with the talks. The consumer groups do not believe the complaint will be included in the FTC’s privacy investigation of Facebook, because that case appears to be nearing its completion. But the children’s advocacy groups said they hope their complaint will continue a drumbeat of pressure for Facebook to take more forceful steps to change its business practices oriented toward children. “This is a pattern of behavior,” said Jim Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media. “Facebook has a moral obligation to change its culture towards practices that foster the well-being of kids and families, and the FTC should ensure Facebook is acting responsibly.” Facebook said that in 2016 it had updated some of its policies governing purchases by minors. “We have in place mechanisms to prevent fraud at the time of purchase, and we offer people the option to dispute purchases and seek refunds,” the company said. “As part of our long history of working with parents and experts to offer tools for families navigating Facebook and the web, Facebook also has safeguards in place regarding minors’ purchases.” The FTC declined to comment. Details about the in-app purchases came from court documents that were unsealed at the request of the Center for Investigative Reporting, a nonprofit journalism organization. The documents were part of a class-action lawsuit brought in 2012 and settled in 2016 for an undisclosed sum. The 135 pages of unsealed documents included internal memos and emails in which Facebook employees encouraged game developers to create features that would get children to make credit card charges while playing games. In many cases, the children did not realize that their parents’ credit cards were attached to the games or that they were spending real money, the consumer groups argued in their complaint. The FTC polices consumer fraud, deception and unfair practices and is well versed in the issue of in-app purchases — the charges made within an app and directly charged through iTunes or Google Play stores, for example. In 2013, the agency started an investigation into major charges by children using in-app purchases for things like “gold coins” in smartphone games. The FTC reached a $32.5 million settlement with Apple and a $19 million settlement with Google over accusations that children were deceived into making such purchases and that the companies did not properly disclose to parents that they were being charged for their children’s purchases.Under the  threat of huge penalties,  Airbnb, HomeAway, FlipKey and others have  jettisoned hosts  who ignored the city’s registration requirement for short-term rentals. That’s dramatically revamped the universe of listings, erasing more than half, tilting the market even more toward Airbnb, easing enforcement of local laws, and returning some rental units to a city that desperately needs them. The Chronicle asked  Host Compliance,  a San Francisco company that helps cities monitor vacation rentals, to capture snapshots of Airbnb, HomeAway and FlipKey in late August, just before a legal agreement required Airbnb and HomeAway to start telling hosts to register or get kicked off. Host Compliance then extracted data from the three sites on Jan. 19, just after a deadline for all Airbnb and HomeAway hosts to register. (FlipKey did not have the same deadline but is subject to the same requirements.) “The regulations had a massive impact on the number of rentals in the city, with an overall 55 percent reduction,” said Ulrik Binzer, Host Compliance CEO and founder. Airbnb saw the smallest percentage loss. Both HomeAway and FlipKey showcase many second homes, which cannot qualify as vacation rentals here because the owners are not permanent residents. Neither of those two sites list private rooms or shared rooms, which remain staples on Airbnb. A stricter enforcement system has transformed San Francisco’s market for short-term vacation rentals. Airbnb and HomeAway agreed to delist hosts who haven’t registered with the city over a five-month period starting in September. FlipKey jettisoned unregistered hosts too. These snapshots show the composition of the market before (Aug. 29) and after (Jan. 19) the purge of unregistered hosts. “We see Jan. 16, 2018, as a hard reset,” said Airbnb spokesman Christopher Nulty. “We’re proud of the fact that as of then, every listing on our platform in San Francisco is in full compliance with the rules.” Airbnb listings fell from 8,740 in August to 4,191 in January, data showed. That number includes a couple of hundred listings at hotels, hostels and time shares, which don’t have to register. Airbnb said in addition it has 2,480 listings exempt from registration because they rent for more than 30 days. FlipKey, owned by TripAdvisor, said it worked closely with San Francisco to comply with its laws. Its listings plunged from 401 in August to 78 in January. HomeAway, owned by Expedia, did not respond to requests for comment. It had 1,208 listings in August; 509 in January. The data further reveal a series of dramatic alterations in how the short-term rental market works in San Francisco. Caption Close Frequent renters.  Entire homes with frequent streams of tourists are a controversial category. The city caps whole-home rentals at 90 days. Vacation rentals where the host is present have no cap. While prolific whole-home listings remain, many may be suites in people’s homes, which are legal to rent year-round. For instance, Gustav Choto and his wife, Nataly, turned the family room in their Crocker-Amazon home into an Airbnb rental. They’ve outfitted it with a microwave, coffee maker and mini fridge, and list it as a whole home, which some travelers prefer. But others prefer to socialize. “Sometimes we just pop open the door (to the rest of the house) so we can hang out with the guests,” Choto said. Many of the busiest listings are hotels. The most-booked Airbnb properties are the Bartlett Hotel, the Green Tortoise Hostel and the 325 Hotel. Some may be properties that have applied to register and can stay on the site while their applications are pending. There are 900 registrations in process. “Some of what you are seeing as noncompliant listings would be weeded out through our review — and ultimately denial — of such applications,” said Kevin Guy, director of the Office of Short-Term Rentals. At the other end of the spectrum, dormant listings — ones with little or no activity — virtually vanished. Many locals may have thrown up a listing in early 2016 hoping to lure lucrative Super Bowl visitors without ever having hosted. Most neighborhoods saw a big drop in listings, with the biggest declines in areas with a larger proportion of renters. Some renters may have decided to forgo registration because it requires that the city contact their landlords. Neighborhood impact.  The Mission remains the most-popular neighborhood for vacation rentals, but it now has 505 listings across all three sites, down from 1,127 in August. Some neighborhoods, such as Russian Hill, Nob Hill, Mission Bay and Western Addition, had particularly steep declines in listings. Hosts and others said that’s because those areas have a higher concentration of renters who didn’t want to register, because that process involves the city contacting their landlord — and subletting may violate their leases. Lakeshore saw a steep decline, which the Office of Short-Term Rentals attributes to college students who rent at the Parkmerced complex scrubbing their Airbnb listings. Treasure Island, run by an agency that does not allow vacation rentals, saw all its listings wiped out. But not all landlords eschew Airbnb rentals. In 2015, when Ryan Booth first saw a North of Panhandle flat on the top floor of a Queen Anne Victorian, the landlord said he wanted prospective tenants to compete with their best offer. Booth said he could pay $5,000 a month if the landlord gave him permission to rent via Airbnb — and he landed the place. He turned the living room into his bedroom and the original bedroom into a space for tourists. After expenses, it covers about 60 percent of his rent, although it’s more work than simply having a roommate. “In my mind it’s worth the extra effort,” he said. “I like interacting with guests.” The law of supply and demand suggests that shrinking the number of listings would send prices up. Instead, by eliminating little-used or overpriced listings, San Francisco’s registration push was followed by price drops. In addition, there’s seasonal variation: “Before” data are from August, during the summer travel season, while “after” data are from the slow winter months, when some hosts cut prices to attract guests. The housing market.  HotPads, the Zillow Group’s rentals site, saw an unprecedented surge of new ads for apartments to rent the third week in January — just as the registration deadline kicked in. The increased inventory did not affect pricing. HotPads said the increased listings were existing buildings heavily concentrated in the Mission, South of Market and South Beach, all popular Airbnb spots. It appears “that a large number of people who got lopped off Airbnb changed to advertising as long-term rentals,” said Joshua Clark, HotPads economist. But Airbnb disputed that, noting that HotPads does not release the exact numbers of units, and that HotPads overall is growing as it catches up with Craigslist. In fact, HotPads showed that total San Francisco inventory rose only modestly in the third week in January, which it attributes to rapid absorption. Even the San Francisco Office of Short-Term Rentals cautioned that it’s a leap to portray the city ban as the sole cause of a dramatic increase in rentals. Some, but not all of the gain, could be because of former short-term rental listings, Guy said. For instance, his office weeded out some syndicates in South of Market that rented out three to 10 properties and ran high-volume Airbnbs. Those presumably now have been returned to the rental pool. “I think Airbnb was a convenient scapegoat for not addressing the root causes” of San Francisco’s housing shortage, such as failure to build enough units, said David Jacoby, an Airbnb host who also runs a business called  Hostfully  that helps hosts create digital guidebooks for their spaces. The least active hosts were most likely to be removed. San Francisco law restricts entire-home rentals while the host is absent to 90 days a year. Most listings appear to comply, but some hosts will have to rent less often. While many units were rented beyond the city’s cap, some might be suites within homes or hotels, both of which are not subject to the limit. Multiple-property hosts.  San Francisco wants to catch landlords who turn apartments into hotels. Hosts who list several vacation rentals around the city are an obvious target because no one can live in multiple residences. The number of hosts with multiple listings shrank. While there are still 600 hosts who control two or more listings, the Office of Short-Term Rentals thinks they fall into permissible categories. Many are property managers, either professionals or family members, Guy said. Hosts with a couple of listings could easily be people with two or more bedrooms to rent, or a bedroom plus the entire unit when they are away. With the registration system, the city can see for itself if this is the case. “By and large, folks who take multiple units off the market have been swept out through enforcement and this  settlement agreement  process,” he said. Longer-term short-term.  There’s a loophole for landlords who can’t register because they don’t live here. They can rent for a minimum of 30 days, exempting them from registration. Airbnb said it has 2,480 such listings. HomeAway and FlipKey showcases scores of these rentals. Although 30-plus day rentals are less popular — and less lucrative — than the shorter-term ones, they can lure corporate travelers or people relocating. “A lot of people are switching to (30-plus) day rentals,” said Emily Benkert, who runs Guesthop, a vacation-management service. “They’re not greedy slumlords. They’re people who travel a lot, and have multiple homes; they may be bicoastal. They don’t want to rent out full time and be stuck with a tenant for the rest of their life.” Many hosts say they’ve made peace with the new system and hope it will usher in a new era of detente between Airbnb and its hometown. “I think it’s a good idea,” homeowner Choto said. “We’ve all seen how some people were not true to the spirit of Airbnb, which is a hosted experience. There were people out there who used to make profit and take properties off the market, which I think is wrong. It’s good to hold people to standards.” Among hosts, “not everyone is happy with how this all happened,” Jacoby said. “But they’ve come to terms with this as a fair compromise.” Carolyn Said is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

A hodge-podge of recent economic data is fueling concerns over risks to global growth and the world\\'s two biggest economies are locked in a trade war spurred by U.S. contentions that China uses predatory tactics in a quest to overtake U.S. technological dominance, including pressuring American companies to hand over trade secrets and in some cases stealing them outright. The Trump administration has warned it will increase its import taxes on $200 billion in Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent if the two sides haven\\'t reached a resolution by March 2. But Trump in recent days has signaled a willingness to extend the deadline if negotiators are making progress. \"The trade talks do appear to have made some progress. However, a run of weak data from Japan, Europe and the U.S. yesterday took the wind out of the equity market sails,\" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.

This is especially true in San Francisco’s market, where both buyers and sellers are connected and on the go. To serve clients, success requires me to be fast and available. Properties hit the Multiple Listing Service or are updated at all times of the day. Clients need to be aware of these changes as they happen. But I am not behind a desk. I’m in the city evaluating properties or neighborhoods with clients. A smartphone allows me to stay on top of changes. Also, the advantage belongs to the person with clear command of the most relevant information. That may include square feet, number of bedrooms and days on market. There is so much more information, and smart agents and their clients know how to use this to their advantage. My phone surpasses the most powerful desktop systems of 10 years ago, and I can find the smallest details about a property, including tax records, owner histories and comparable sales. Finally, this is a customer service business, and my phone allows me to stay in contact with my client. Jen Chang, Vanguard Properties, 415-990-4495,  jenchangsf@gmail.com .  A:  As a new Realtor in 1990, I argued we didn’t need to acquire an office fax machine. I took the Luddite stance that it was better to write offers in ink, drive them across town and deliver them in person. (Within six months, I had a home fax machine.) I now embrace new technology like a nonchalant Millennial. But if asked to pick my desert-island essential, I’ll grab my phone. Not because it’s smart but because the clarity and warmth of voice contact can’t be typed. We Realtors rely too heavily on emails and texts. They’re often efficient, but they depersonalize a personal enterprise and can impair complex communications. Just today, my texting with a painter, a plumber and a homeowner quickly disintegrated into chaos. So instead I called each of them and the wall behind the new toilet got painted in time for photography. Thank you, Mr. Alexander Graham Bell.

Teresa Baum,  Compass,  510-219-3404,  teresa.baum@compass.com .The owners of the  1982-era Crocker Galleria mall  in San Francisco want to revamp the Financial District property with an updated exterior, open-air restaurant space and new staircases. Developers hope the $30 million in proposed renovations will help the three-story property at 50 Post St. attract local food vendors and shops. Developer City Center Realty Partners and owner PGIM Real Estate, a division of insurance giant Prudential, pitched the plan to the San Francisco Planning Commission, which is expected to consider it in the coming weeks. In a real estate trend as San Francisco continues to add jobs, the plan also calls for converting 6,665 of the center’s 90,000 square feet of retail space to offices. “With a bold reimagining, this extraordinary asset has the potential to catalyze change in the area,” Sigurd Anderson, CEO of City Center Realty Partners, said in a statement. “We believe our firm’s urban real estate expertise will guide a strategy to breathe new life into the Galleria, and create a vibrant anchor for the heart of downtown San Francisco.” Other malls around the Bay Area have sought to modernize through renovations or a new mix of tenants as the retail sector has struggled with bankruptcies and a shift to online shopping. A revamp of the former Macy’s in Stonestown Galleria  in San Francisco’s Sunset District calls for new restaurants  and a movie theater. Both  Westfield San Francisco Centre downtown   and the nearby  vacant 6x6 mall  have partial office space conversion plans. Crocker Galleria has around 35 shops and restaurants. As of last week, six vacant spaces were visible on the first and second floors. Recent closures included T-We Tea, which had a temporary pop-up space, and Luxe Pieces, a jewelry store that relocated to the San Francisco Gift Center and Jewelry Mart in Showplace Square. The idea of renovating Crocker Galleria is promising, said Margaret Murray, who works nearby and was eating lunch at the mall Friday. Murray said the existing retailers seem outdated or a bad fit for office-worker patrons, such as the boutique Aricie Lingerie, which sells intimate apparel. She also feels the food options are unhealthy. “It doesn’t foster a sense of community,” said Murray, who would also like to see an expansion of the Thursday farmers’ market. Crocker Galleria, steps from Montgomery BART Station, was built as part of a development deal in the late 1970s involving its namesake, the former Crocker Bank. The bank built a 500-foot tower at the adjacent 120 Kearny St., along with the Crocker Galleria in a former alley, which maintained a public walkway. It also removed 10 floors from the adjacent 1 Montgomery St., which is now a two-story Wells Fargo bank branch with a rooftop public space that connects to the mall. In 2016, early plans for a 500-foot hotel and condo tower were proposed for  1 Montgomery St. , but the San Francisco Planning Department  opposed the plan  because it would remove public space. No formal proposal was filed, according to city records. More modest changes are moving forward in the area, with office renovations planned and under way at 1 Post St. — soon to be the  former headquarters of McKesson  — and  111 Sutter St. Technology and health care companies led U.S. stocks higher Friday, giving the benchmark S&P 500 its fourth straight weekly gain. The broad rally came as investors grew hopeful that the latest round of talks between the U.S. and China will lead to a resolution of the costly trade war that\\'s unsettled markets and threatened the global economy. High-level discussions between the Trump administration and Chinese negotiators were slated to continue through the weekend. President Donald Trump told reporters Friday afternoon that it was \"more likely\" that the talks will result in a deal. Uncertainty over trade has contributed to a dimmer outlook for corporate earnings growth this year and added to concerns about the global economy, which is showing some signs of slowing. \"Investors are clearly optimistic that a compromise on trade talks will be coming sooner rather than later and those expectations appear to be reflected in the market rebound we see today,\" said Saira Malik, head of global equities at Nuveen. The S&P 500 index rose 17.79 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,792.67. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 181.18 points, or 0.7 percent, to 26,031.81. The Nasdaq composite climbed 67.84 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,527.54. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies picked up 14.51 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,590.06. Major European indexes finished higher. The world\\'s two biggest economies are locked in a trade conflict spurred by U.S. contentions that China uses predatory tactics to overtake U.S. technological dominance, including pressuring American companies to hand over trade secrets and in some cases stealing them outright. The Trump administration has warned it will increase its import taxes on $200 billion in Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent if the two sides haven\\'t reached a resolution by March 2. But the White House has signaled a willingness to extend the deadline if negotiators are making progress. President Donald Trump, fielding questions from reporters in the Oval Office late Friday afternoon, reiterated that he would \"certainly consider\" delaying that deadline if talks are going well. The negotiations were slated to continue through the weekend. Asked about the prospects for a deal, Trump said: \"It\\'s probably more likely that a deal does happen.\" Wall Street has been encouraged by the signals that Chinese and U.S. officials have sent since trade talks resumed early last week. That helped lift the market, along with better-than-expected company earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 and the Federal Reserve\\'s decision to take a pause on interest rate hikes. \"But the bigger picture is that with the market having such a nice rally year-to-date, we actually think we\\'re in for a period of consolidation,\" Malik said. \"Until you can see sustainable global economic growth, we think it\\'s going to be tough for the market to really move a lot higher from here.\" Traders also weighed a mix of company earnings reports Friday. Wayfair jumped 27.9 percent after the online home furnishings retailer reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street\\'s forecasts. Universal Display climbed 23 percent after the LED technology company posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings and its guidance surpassed investor expectations. Zillow Group climbed 24.7 percent a day after the online real estate information company issued quarterly earnings that topped analysts\\' expectations. The company also said co-founder Rich Barton has been named chief executive. Barton previously held the job from 2005 until 2010. Kraft Heinz plunged 27.5 percent after the packaged foods company posted a stunning $12.6 billion fourth-quarter loss as it slashed the value of its Oscar Mayer and Kraft brands by $15.4 billion. The company also disclosed it was being investigated by federal securities regulators and cut its dividend. Dropbox slid 8.4 percent after the online data storage company issued a disappointing outlook. Stamps.com plunged 57.8 percent after the online shipping and postage company ended its exclusive partnership with the U.S. Postal Service and gave a weak forecast. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 0.5 percent to settle at $57.26 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 0.1 percent to close at $67.12 a barrel in London.

Natural gas gained 0.7 percent to $2.72 per 1,000 cubic feet.Stores and restaurants in several states would be required to do something pretty basic if certain lawmakers have their way: accept their customers’ cash. The legislation comes amid a worldwide move toward “cashless payments” using cards or mobile devices, which supporters say are safer, quicker and more convenient. But critics say an outright ban on cash discriminates against those without credit or bank accounts, and raises concerns about privacy and data security. Last week, Supervisor Vallie Brown proposed an ordinance that would require businesses in San Francisco to accept cash. The New Jersey Legislature and the Philadelphia City Council have passed measures this year that would ban cashless stores. New York City, Washington and Chicago are weighing similar bills. “A no-cash sign is a not-welcome sign for many who don’t have access to banking services,” Brown said at a Board of Supervisors meeting. “The unbanked are all around us. They’re young people who don’t qualify for credit cards, seniors and low-income folks on fixed incomes or prefer to use cash.” A report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in 2017 estimated that 6.5 percent of U.S. households did not have bank accounts. The penalties in the proposed bills range from hundreds to thousands of dollars. San Francisco’s proposed fines range from $50 to $1,000, depending on the number of offenses. In the New Jersey bill, they could go up to $5,000 for a second offense. A spokesman said the governor was considering whether to sign the legislation. New Jersey state Sen. Nellie Pou, who is sponsoring one of the bills, said that business groups and Amazon had expressed opposition to the bill, and she worked with businesses to include exceptions, including for airports, parking facilities, car rental companies and any “internet-based transaction.” She added that she had asked Amazon, which is operating five pop-up stores and one bookstore in New Jersey, to come up with ideas for how they could serve those without a bank account, but that she did not hear back. Amazon declined to comment. Massachusetts has a little-known law requiring retail stores to accept both cash and credit. There have been calls for the legislature to clarify whether the law, approved in 1978, applies to restaurants. Retailers that have adopted cash-free policies argue that most of their customers already pay electronically and that not having to fumble with cash makes the lines go faster. Without cash on hand, employees are free from a number of related tasks, like counting it and transporting it to the bank or an armored truck. A lack of cash also cuts down the danger of robbery or theft. “It’s more efficient for our teams and restaurants because they’ll get back hours of their day to cook and spend time with you in the restaurant instead of the administrative work associated with cash,” the salad chain Tender Greens said in an online statement when it put a cash-free policy in place last year. Other shops and restaurants that have instituted cash-free policies — some in just one location, some in many or all — include Starbucks, Dig Inn, Dos Toros, Sweetgreen and Argo Tea. In-flight purchases on airplanes have been cash-free for a long time, and some government offices do not accept cash. Ritchie Torres, a councilman from the Bronx who introduced the New York City bill, said he has concerns about the implications of a cashless economy “for New Yorkers who face historically rooted barriers to both credit and banking.” “What if you have no papers? What if you have no credit history?” he asked, adding that others may prefer cash to protect their data and privacy. “The goal here is not to stifle technological progress,” he said. “A cashless payment can be one option among many, but it should never be the sole option.” Stephanie Martz, senior vice president and general counsel of the National Retail Federation, argued that businesses should be able to decide themselves how to operate. But she added that only a handful of businesses are experimenting with cashless payments, and that the vast majority of small purchases are still made in cash. Chronicle staff contributed to this report.Pacific Gas and Electric Co. will not award any of its planned $130 million in 2018 performance bonuses to thousands of employees after deciding the payments were inappropriate in light of the company’s bankruptcy and the wildfires that have killed dozens of people and destroyed tens of thousands of homes. John Simon, interim CEO of the utility’s parent company PG&E Corp., announced the decision Friday in an internal message to employees that was reviewed by The Chronicle. The payments were set to be awarded next month and about 14,000 employees were eligible, PG&E previously told the bankruptcy court. PG&E had stressed publicly that it was not seeking to award the bonuses to any of its top executives this year, and union leaders described them as part of the normal pay for the thousands of employees who had participated in the program. Simon said the decision was “immensely difficult” and his own view on the issue “evolved over time.” “The more I stepped back and thought about the impacts the wildfires have had on so many people outside our company, regardless of fault, the more I came to believe paying (performance bonuses) in 2018 was not the right thing to do,” Simon said in the email. While PG&E is scrapping its requested performance pay for last year, the company does plan to seek permission to institute a different kind of program for 2019 which could give employees incentive awards as soon as April, Simon said. Senior PG&E leaders and the board of directors decided not to move forward with the payments “because to do so would, in effect, put ourselves at the front of the line for that payment ahead of thousands” of other people with claims against the company and creditors “who we currently cannot pay and who must await resolution” of the bankruptcy process, Simon said in the email. He acknowledged that the decision would be “an unpopular one with our employees.” And one of the company’s top union leaders suggested it was. “We’re very upset,” said John Mader, president of the Engineers and Scientists of California Local 20, IFPTE, which represents 3,700 professional and technical PG&E employees, about 1,200 of whom receive payments through the short-term incentive program. “I just don’t see how it’s constructive to confiscate employee compensation, especially the people ... who try and prevent these kind of tragedies.” Mader, a PG&E electrical distribution engineer, is personally affected by the company’s decision. He said he worried that the payments would be reduced in bankruptcy and characterized the move to eliminate them entirely as unfair to employees who “didn’t make the decisions” that led to recent wildfires. State investigators have found PG&E responsible for a series of 2017 wildfires, but not the worst one from that year. The cause of last year’s horrific Camp Fire is still under investigation, but the company’s equipment may be found at fault — a fact acknowledged by Simon in his email. Consumer Watchdog president Jamie Court had lambasted the performance bonus request and called Simon’s announcement “the least they could do considering fire victims are not getting paid.” “I think this is just crisis management,” he said. “Clearly, it’s the right decision, but it should have been done in the first place, not after a public shaming.” PG&E spokeswoman Lynsey Paulo said the company’s decision affected all eligible employees, including senior leaders, and would be relayed to the bankruptcy committees and court. In his email, Simon explained the short-term incentive program was not guaranteed, and while the measures the company had in place determined they earned such bonuses, he questioned if those criteria were appropriate. He cited the loss of life and destroyed structures, but also questioned whether such rewards should be given out after the company’s many financial blows, including losing half of its market value, a drop which cost investors more than $10 billion, and filing for bankruptcy. “Looking at the whole picture, can we say we met the spirit of our plans for the year? Considering the impacts of the wildfires, should we be paying ourselves for our performance last year?” Simon asked his employees in his email. “We felt the answer was no.” All that being said, Simon added that, in March, the company will ask the bankruptcy judge to approve bonuses going forward in 2019, if performance benchmarks are met, potentially paying employees in April, July, October, and January. The rewards will be based 50 percent on safety, although the company raised “financial stewardship” to 40 percent weight and 10 percent for customer-related measures, Simon said. The company will also offer merit raises above base pay in March, Simon said.A Bay Area lawmaker who has been a longtime critic of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. on Friday introduced a series of new bills aimed at tightening control over the embattled utility in light of its recent bankruptcy filing and the devastating wildfires that have plagued the state. Only one of three bills from state Sen. Jerry Hill, D-San Mateo, has language  exclusively focused on PG&E, but all are clearly targeted at ensuring greater state oversight of the utility as it  restructures  in Bankruptcy Court and tries to prevent its power lines from starting more wildfires. Hill has frequently sought to tighten oversight of the company since the  2010 San Bruno pipeline explosion , which occurred in his district. One of the bills would require legislative approval of PG&E rate increases, which Hill views as necessary to keep customers financially protected during the bankruptcy. “We’re looking at that as the ability for the Legislature to have a role in the approval of the rate structures determined by the (California Public Utilities Commission) as PG&E moves out of bankruptcy,” Hill said in an interview. “That’s the purpose of it.” The goal of all three bills is to “protect the ratepayers and consumers of PG&E from excessive rates and from hazardous conditions” and future disasters caused by the company’s power equipment, Hill said. A PG&E spokeswoman said the company has not yet reviewed the bills. State investigators found PG&E equipment responsible for a series of Northern California fires in 2017, though not the  worst one  from that year, and the company may also be liable for last year’s devastating Camp Fire in Butte County, the cause of which is  still  under investigation. The utility and its parent company PG&E Corp. filed for bankruptcy protection last month, citing liabilities from 2017 and 2018 fires that could exceed $30 billion. The first piece of legislation from Hill, SB548, would require the California Public Utilities Commission to mandate a schedule for when electric utilities inspect their transmission lines but does not specify how often those inspections must occur. It’s a significant proposal because a PG&E transmission tower  may have sparked  the Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history. Transmission lines are also regulated at the federal level. Hill said his office’s research indicated the state does have authority over how that infrastructure is inspected. He said he put the bill forward because “utilities pretty much set their own standards” for inspecting transmission lines. “There is a vacuum of regulations related to transmission lines, and I think we need to fill that,” he said. The second bill, SB549, is the measure that would prohibit the utilities commission from approving any PG&E rate changes without approval from the Legislature. That would represent a major expansion of state lawmakers’ oversight of the utility and its regulators. The third bill, SB550, would require the utilities commission to ensure that any merger, acquisition or change in control of a large electric or gas company improves the safety of the service the utility provides. The utility in question would have to have a comprehensive safety plan in place, a strategy to maintain or improve records of its facilities and safety-related metrics, among other requirements. PG&E may sell off its gas assets as part of its bankruptcy restructuring. Mark Toney, executive director of The Utility Reform Network consumer group, said he supports the spirit of Hill’s proposals but had not yet read through all of the bills. Toney’s group wants to make sure regulators do not cut a “backroom deal” with PG&E, which is what he believes happened when the utility last filed for bankruptcy during the energy crisis of the early 2000s. “We think that the Legislature needs to make sure that the (utilities commission) does its job in protecting ratepayers and not giving away the store,” Toney said. Hill said he, too, was mindful of PG&E’s last bankruptcy when he crafted the new legislative package. “After the last bankruptcy, PG&E came out of that and swore they ... would be responsible and do everything right,” Hill said. “Obviously, they didn’t, as we see in so many instances — not just the San Bruno explosion, but the fires and all these other things. I don’t believe we can leave it to chance this time.”A wife and husband who  owned and operated an elder care facility in Vallejo  were indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday for distributing and manufacturing methamphetamine pills that featured the Tesla logo, Kool-Aid’s smiling pitcher and President Trump’s name and likeness, authorities said. Roselle Cipriano, 36, and Henry Benson, 37, face charges that include conspiracy to distribute and manufacture methamphetamine, distribution of methamphetamine, possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, and possession of a firearm to commit a drug-trafficking crime, according to the Department of Justice. If convicted, Cipriano and Benson face 10 years to life in prison and a $1 million fine. The married couple were taken into custody Feb. 7 at their business, Genesis Care Home for the Elderly, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Authorities found a pill press, 31 pounds of methamphetamine pills, 17 pounds of suspected methamphetamine, various other powders and manufacturing equipment, and a shotgun within 3 feet of the pills at the elder care facility, prosecutors said. A search of the couple’s storage facility allegedly turned up five additional pill presses, hazardous material clothing, and additional powder suspected of containing narcotics. The DEA’s Sacramento office began investigating the couple in 2017 after learning of a suspected counterfeit tablet operation, authorities said. An undercover investigation resulted in purchases of thousands of tablets that varied in color and logo. Some of the yellow tablets had the Tesla emblem, others bore the smiling pitcher of the Kool-Aid Man and additional tablets were embossed with the likeness of Trump, whose last name was stamped on the back, authorities said. Some tablets were in the shape of blue minions. Laboratory tests determined the pills had traces of methamphetamine, and agents identified Cipriano and Benson as the source of the pills. The care facility, whose ownership is under Cipriano’s name, remains open and residents are being taken care of by medical staff, authorities said.A couple likely wasn’t “lovin’ it” Wednesday afternoon after being robbed of their McChicken sandwich and coffee by a knife-wielding bandit outside a San Francisco McDonald’s, police said. The Hamburglar struck at 3:30 p.m. in front of the golden arches on Market and Second streets, pulling a blade on a 47-year-old man and 58-year-old woman, officials said. Police later apprehended the yet-to-be-identified McChicken mugger.Amid the millionaires and billionaires of Silicon Valley, the working poor and cash-strapped college students struggle to pay ever-increasing rent, leaving little left over for food. And, increasingly, they are turning to Second Harvest Food Bank for help. These workers, many with two jobs, and college kids with full course loads have upended the image of the hungry, said Leslie Bacho, Second Harvest chief executive. “More and more of the people we see are working,” she said. “What we see is for so many people, especially outside the tech sector, wages have been relatively flat.” For 32 years, The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing Fund has helped more than 150,000 Bay Area individuals and families facing unexpected life crises.

Despite low unemployment and a relatively strong economy, food banks are seeing an increasing number of clients every year, with 260,000 people currently served by Second Harvest in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties each month. “Unfortunately for so many of the people we serve, things have not gotten that much better,” Bacho said. “Often food is the first to go when you’re trying to pay your medical bills, or you want to stay housed.” For 32 years, The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing fund has contributed to Second Harvest and other Bay Area food banks, providing  a total of $21 million to help  provide meals to needy individuals and families. It’s money the food banks can count on year after year, Bacho said. “Since the fund started, it has provided over $5 million to Second Harvest,” she said, adding that’s the equivalent of 10 million meals. “Knowing that you have funders you can count on year after year really helps us for our planning.” But the food banks still have had to get creative to be able to serve the wide range of people in need. To better help students, Second Harvest has opened food pantries in 10 community colleges and at San Jose State University. “So many of the students are struggling to afford rent, tuition and still have leftover (money) for food,” Bacho said. Once the word got out, she said, the students started coming. “It has been surprising to me the success of having distribution on these college campuses,” she said. Lauren Cook was working four jobs while attending San Jose State when she first saw a flyer for the on-campus food pantry. She and her roommate started going once a month, filling their refrigerator and cupboards with rice, eggs, milk, fruit, vegetables and even the occasional whole chicken. The food allowed her to cut back on work hours some and eat healthy meals. A college student “shouldn’t have to live off Ramen and crap food,” she said. Cook graduated in 2017 and now is working at a Sunnyvale tech startup, where she’s running a food drive for Second Harvest, “to thank them for all the help they’ve given me.” Meanwhile, with the cost of housing skyrocketing, a family of four in Santa Clara County earning $94,450 or less is considered low-income by the federal government — meaning many people with jobs need help putting food on the table. Second Harvest adjusted schedules to serve working families, opening more pantries on the weekends and in the evenings. All told, the food bank distributes 66 million pounds of food each year — the equivalent of 55 million meals. Second Harvest has also gotten creative in finding alternative sources of food, with volunteers hitting up 100 Starbucks stores each day to pick up salads, sandwiches, protein boxes and other items with a limited shelf life to distribute to shelters and other locations. But even with donations of food, the food bank has to raise $40 million annually to back fill the need — purchasing milk, eggs, chicken. About a quarter of the food distributed is purchased, Bacho said. Last year,  the Season of Sharing Fund distributed $1.3 million to Second Harvest and other food banks in the nine Bay Area counties to buy fresh produce and healthy food. Of the money raised by Season of Sharing each year, 15 percent of the fund’s annual proceeds go to the food banks. The rest of the Season of Sharing funds are provided to individuals throughout the region who have  urgent needs  — a month of rent, tires for a car, furniture or money for medical expenses. For the food banks, however, the Season of Sharing is putting food on tables in Silicon Valley and communities across the region, Bacho said. “We’re always thinking about how to reach the people who haven’t needed us before,” she said. “It’s becoming an impossible place to live.”The Raiders appear to be close to wrapping up a deal to keep the team playing at the Oakland Coliseum this year and possibly in 2020. An announcement is expected this week or early next week, according to sources close to the talks. “It’s for one year for sure, with an option for the second year,” said one source who could not speak on the record because of the sensitive nature of the negotiations. Under the proposed deal, the Raiders would pay $7.5 million this year with the rent rising to $10.5 million if the team stays on through 2020. The option for an extra year is insurance in case the team’s new $1.8 billion stadium in Las Vegas isn’t ready. “All of the major issues ... have been resolved,” the source said. The deal is being worked out between Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority Executive Director Scott McKibben and Raiders President Marc Badain. Authority members have been kept abreast of the talks in closed session and are barred from speaking publicly on the details at this point. “But I’d say there is a better than 50-50 shot,” Coliseum Authority board member Chris Dobbins said. The Raiders didn’t immediately return calls for comment. If the lease deal goes through, it would be the latest chapter in the ongoing soap opera over the Raiders’ highly charged exit from the Bay Area. The Raiders walked away from a one-year, $7.5 million lease extension at the Coliseum in December after the city of Oakland joined a lawsuit seeking millions in damages for the team’s move to Las Vegas. Raiders owner Mark Davis didn’t want to play in a city that was suing him. Since pulling away from that deal, the Raiders have been in talks with the San Francisco 49ers and the San Francisco Giants about playing six to eight home games at either Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara or at Oracle Park on the San Francisco waterfront. The 49ers and Raiders exchanged term sheets on a deal to temporarily share the Santa Clara stadium, which was built for two teams, but it’s unclear how far the talks went. The talks with the Giants were complicated both by the need to get the 49ers’ permission for the Raiders to play in downtown San Francisco — part of the 49ers’ NFL territory — and by concerns from City Hall that neighborhoods near Oracle Park would be overwhelmed with traffic and tailgaters on game days. Word is that both deals would have cost more than what the Oakland Coliseum was offering and would have been inconvenient for the team, which is still headquartered in Alameda. The team’s decision to re-engage with Coliseum officials follows NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell’s pre-Super Bowl comment that the league needs to start scheduling its 2019 season and that he expects a decision “soon” on where the Raiders would play their home games. “We could have stuck it to them, but instead they kept the same deal on the table,” that the Raiders had walked away from, said one source with knowledge of the talks. Job bank:  Even while calling for big changes in state policies, new California Gov. Gavin Newsom is sticking to the longtime tradition of appointing former lawmakers and political allies to nice-paying jobs on state commissions. First up, former California Professional Firefighters President Louis Paulson of Walnut Creek. Newsom just nominated him to a $153,689-a-year seat on the Public Employment Relations Board. The firefighters were a key backer of Newsom’s campaign for governor. Next, labor leader Art Pulaski of Berkeley, whom Newsom reappointed to a $58,633-a-year seat on the State Compensation Insurance Fund Board of Directors, where he has served since 2018. Pulaski has served as executive secretary-treasurer and chief officer of the 2.1 million-member California Labor Federation since 1996. The federation endorsed Newsom for governor. And, in the once-a-lawmaker category, Newsom appointed former Assemblyman Michael Allen of Santa Rosa, to a $153,689-a-year seat on the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board. Allen served as assistant Assembly majority leader in 2011 and 2012. Other unemployment board members include former state Sen. Marty Block; Dan Reeves, who was chief of staff to several legislative leaders; and former Deputy Attorney General Ralph Lightstone.Five days a week, eight hours a day, Karen Chaney stands at a Walmart cash register, working a full-time job at 67 to make sure she can stay above water financially and keep her East Oakland house. “It’s hard,” Chaney said as she sat on her living room sofa on a recent day off. “I come home every night and have to take hot Epsom salt baths because my body hurts so bad.” Things could have been much worse for Chaney. In fact, they almost were until The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing helped her keep her home, which is festooned with photos of her two daughters, granddaughter and, over the fireplace, a black-and-white graduation picture from Oakland’s Castlemont High. That photo depicts Chaney’s sister, Glenda Hammonds, who died in September 2013. Hammonds had lived in the house for 30 years and bequeathed it to Chaney, a blessing that the retiree nearly lost.

Chaney also inherited two mortgages, which she was able to pay despite a “very fixed” income from Social Security and retiree benefits from the city of Berkeley. That is, until early in 2018. Those mortgages had adjustable rates and shot up by a combined $509, an increase that Chaney struggled to pay. “I was maintaining, and I was able to do it until I got to where I was juggling,” she said. “One month I would pay my first and then my utilities and stuff, and the next month I would pay the second and utilities.” The bank finally told her that was inadequate. “They caught up with me,” Chaney said, “and it came to a head.” That meant default notices and a likely foreclosure, which devastated a woman who knew all too well the perils of trying to find housing in the Bay Area on a limited income. Chaney spent the final six years of her career with the city of Berkeley working for the housing authority, dealing with individuals and families who needed public housing or Section 8 assistance. The thought of losing her own home gave Chaney an ache that Epsom salt could not have cured. “My daughters, I probably could have lived with them, but to me I was still going to be homeless,” she said, “and I did not want to lose my sister’s house after she had been here for 30 years and she left it for me. I never would have been able to afford a house.” A friend who was seeking money for a down payment on a house told Chaney about Season of Sharing, which provides one-time funds to people in unexpected crises. She phoned and left a message, later getting a call back telling her to bring her paperwork to Alameda County Social Services, which helps administer the fund within the county. It took time to sort through her application. Cristina Johnson, a specialist for the social services agency, was moved by Chaney’s story. “I was motivated to help her because she was on the brink of losing her home,” Johnson said. “With the rising housing prices it would have been very difficult for her to be housed if she lost her inherited property.” One day, over the summer, Chaney was lying on her sofa when the phone rang. “It was Season of Sharing,” Chaney said, “and they told me that they had some good news for me, that I was chosen by them to help pay my mortgage, and they were going to help pay my first and the second.” Season of Sharing helped her by providing assistance that brought her current on both mortgages. Chaney started crying into the phone. She cried just talking about it. “It’s been a blessing ever since because, oh my God, they helped me from being out in the streets,” she said. And now? “I’m fine,” she said. “I’m back on track.” Chaney still has to pay the adjusted mortgages of nearly $1,400 a month. She also is paying down a $4,000 property tax bill she received because the taxes she was paying through her bank’s escrow account were not adjusted to cover an increase that was levied after her sister died and the property was reassessed. “I just didn’t want to get caught anymore,” she said. “I needed to go to work.” When her workday is done, Chaney returns home — to her home — which The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing helped her save.Engineers at the state’s Department of Transportation said Friday they will replace 61 joints on the troubled Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, where  crumbling concrete struck a vehicle and caused a nine-hour shutdown this month . Contractors who had  started repairs this week on the 63-year-old span  will now stay on for months, swapping out 31 joints on the upper deck, including the expansion joint that recently failed. Funding for that $10 million maintenance project will come from Bay Area bridge tolls. Later this year, crews will tear out and install 30 more new joints on the lower deck, part of an existing rehabilitation contract. Officials haven’t yet estimated the cost of that work. The repairs will postpone the opening of a long-anticipated bike and pedestrian path along the span by at least three months. Barriers for that path were supposed to go up in April, but now they won’t be installed until June. The 61 sliding plate joints were left out of seismic-retrofit and other fix-it efforts that happened in the early 2000s, a time when the bridge suffered periodic breaks and gashes, including some holes that revealed the water below. During that period, engineers rebuilt 795 of the bridge’s 856 joints, but decided that the remaining 61 — which are located on the truss section and date back to the 1950s — did not need to be replaced. Expansion and sliding plate joints are pieces of steel that connect gaps in the bridge and allow it to move when the temperature changes. They endure constant battering from heavy trucks, briny air and rain. “Look, the freight going through the Bay Area in 2019 is not the traffic mix of 1960,” said Caltrans spokesman Matt Rocco. Rocco noted that now, six decades since the span’s construction, more heavy trucks are traveling between the east and north bay. It does not appear that any vehicle height or weight limits are imposed on the bridge. California Highway Patrol would be in charge of enforcement, and the agency has no scales on the bridge. “We’re a lot of things, but we’re not engineers,” said Andrew Barclay, a spokesman for the CHP unit in Marin. Inspectors checked the upper and lower decks of the bridge last August and found several areas that needed repair. But they did not identify the expansion joint that caused football-sized chunks of debris to break loose on Feb. 7. Following that incident, Caltrans engineers reinspected all of the joints and decided to make the additional fixes “out of an abundance of caution,” said the agency’s District 4 director, Tony Tavares. He stressed that the bridge is structurally sound and will remain open, with intermittent lane closures as crews work during the night. The workhorse bridge has long been known as an ugly, utilitarian sibling of the Bay Area’s six other state-owned spans. But in recent years it’s become more important, with more people commuting from Alameda and Contra Costa counties to jobs in the North Bay. “Now a lot more people rely on it,” said Randy Rentschler, legislative director of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, which manages bridge tolls and major transportation projects throughout the nine-county region. And, he conceded, “there’s no doubt this bridge is showing its age.”California was on fire again. Through this past summer, blazes raged across the state. They threatened cities and hamlets and shut down a national park. Melissa Geissinger couldn’t watch the news anymore. It was too triggering. It tugged her back to early Oct. 9, when the Tubbs Fire blitzed Santa Rosa. Snap. She is in her home in Coffey Park, trying to corral the cats into carriers, clutching the flashlight on her cell phone, and the fire is bearing down. Her heart races. But no — that was nearly a year ago. It isn’t real. Here is what people didn’t tell her about wildfires: After the flames die down and the news crews leave, she would be left to grapple with the tragedy. Healing would come, but slowly, so slowly. The collective emotional trauma wouldn’t disappear. But no one told Melissa that. Who could have? In June,   she and her husband, Cole, had dinner at their friends’ home in Shiloh Ridge. Lance and Barbara Cottrell’s place looked northeast toward Mark West Springs and had almost been destroyed by the Tubbs Fire. They evacuated to Melissa and Cole’s home in Coffey Park, only to have to flee again when the fire arrived there. The Cottrells had gotten lucky. The wind shifted and their home was spared. Now, they were hosting a party for everyone who had crammed into Nancy and Ron Crain’s home last October. They had nicknamed Melissa’s parents’ house in Sebastopol “the Crain Compound” because so many evacuees were camping on air mattresses in their living room. The talk circled back, again and again, to what had survived and what had been lost. Cole’s father, Rich Geissinger (left), has dinner with Melissa’s mom, Nancy Crain, Cole Geissinger and Cole’s father-in-law, Ron Crain, at the Cottrells’ house in Shiloh Ridge. It was easy and comfortable — the type of conversation that was becoming more difficult for Melissa to initiate as the rest of the world moved on. Fire fatigue had set in, and people had begun to rush past the Tubbs in conversations. Melissa watched as white formula seeped down a medical line and into the feeding tube of her son, Ollie. It snaked down his nose. Thick tape kept the tube lodged in place on his cheek. It was a remnant of the 6-month-old’s hospital stays — the open-heart and abdominal surgeries. He still wouldn’t take nourishment like a normal baby. The memories in the Shiloh Ridge house were layered. Melissa and Cole had house-sat there for a week once, before Ollie and before the Tubbs Fire, even though the house didn’t really need sitting. The Cottrells were away on vacation and offered their guest home to the couple. It was as calm and quiet there as the wooded cabin Melissa’s parents owned in Calaveras County when she was a girl. Trees are reflected at the home of Lance and Barbara Cottrell, friends of Melissa and Cole Geissinger, in Shiloh Ridge. She and Cole skinny-dipped in the saltwater pool, which reflected the towering pines and sky. One evening, they accidentally set off the security alarm trying to place a package inside the front door of the main house. They still laughed about that. Later, there was a much different stay, after the miscarriage, when she and Cole had begun fighting and needed a break from each other. Melissa had moved in to the Shiloh Ridge home for a time. Not many people knew about that. Now they were back, this time with a baby. Melissa was happy, not the bright and kicky kind of happy, but more lasting and subdued. For once, she didn’t feel panicked or trapped, like she did when the PTSD swallowed her whole. Maybe this was hope. Maybe they had caught their break. Astrid Granger stood on a chair, reaching into the town house’s kitchen cabinet with a serving spoon. “Somebody gave this to me, but I don’t think I’ll ever use it,” she said, dragging a rice maker from the top shelf. Astrid Granger peers through the window of her new home in Windsor in July. More than eight months after the Tubbs Fire destroyed their home in Santa Rosa, the Grangers finally had a home of their own. It was late June, and the scent of stale coffee wafted through the kitchen. Boxes covered the counters. She and her husband, Henry, had bought a small house in Windsor to replace the one the Tubbs Fire had devoured. They were going home. It had taken more than eight months, through Henry’s hospital stay and every failed offer for a house. They were always being outbid by people who paid in cash. Who has that much cash lying around? At least three times, the Grangers had spread bank statements across their bedspread as they tried to figure out how they would come up with the money for a deposit. Three times it wasn’t enough. They had gotten an insurance settlement, but it wasn’t as big as some other people’s, like those whose showpiece homes had been spread across the hills of the Fountaingrove neighborhood north of Coffey Park. Astrid Granger (center, in white) prays with other members at the closing of church services at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Santa Rosa. “All these people with million-dollar homes got huge payoffs,” Astrid said. “Now they are looking for homes, too. We couldn’t win. We were going crazy with those numbers. Every time you are outbid, you’re crushed.” They had discussed moving to the retirement community of Oakmont, but all Astrid saw was a stream of cleaning ladies and therapists coming, then the ambulance arriving to pick up the residents. She was now 62 — too young for that. It might be OK for Henry, who was in his 70s. But not her. They began arguing, more than they had in four decades of marriage. They were going to go broke buying a home. They scraped nearly every cent they had from their savings and retirement accounts. One Sunday afternoon, their real estate agent took them to tour some listings in the North Bay. One in Rincon Valley had a pool. Another in Windsor was beautiful but too expensive. The last one was 1,300 square feet with three bedrooms. Astrid nearly dismissed it on sight. The exterior color was terra-cotta. It was ugly. But she walked inside and knew. This was it. There were fountains in the backyard and boxes of lavender on the front porch, and even a hot tub. The women who owned the home were moving to Oregon. The Grangers made an offer, and they accepted it. Henry was triumphant. Astrid drank a glass of red wine to celebrate. Astrid Granger in her new home in Windsor in July.  After they went into escrow, a man they had outbid knocked on the front door of the terra-cotta house. The women, who were still living there, answered. He wanted to buy the home out from under the Grangers. They said no. “The audacity that he did that,” Astrid said, her voice cracking. “The nerve of him. But that’s how desperate people are. The man who did that lost his house in the fire, too.” They had been in limbo for almost a year. Not anymore. Astrid stood in the rented town house where they had lived since December and wrapped tea cups and a pink candy dish in newspaper. The floor fan pushed humid air around, and sweat beaded on her face. The TV was showing a World Cup soccer match — her native Germany, the defending champion, was out. Astrid couldn’t believe it. “Winners never think they have to fight,” she said. A push of the remote button took her to a newscast showing a fire in Yolo County. But it barely registered with her. California was a disastrous state — fires, floods, earthquakes. She was surprised it was flames that had gotten them, rather than the ground quaking and opening up or the Russian River overflowing its banks. Not long ago, Astrid had returned to Coffey Park. She was no longer sure where their house had been. The frameworks of a dozen new houses were rising from the dirt. It no longer looked familiar. The redwood tree in their old backyard, tall and massive and seemingly permanent, was gone. Crews had cut it down. Coffey Park wasn’t home anymore. Melissa Geissinger gets some assistance from registered nurse Kelly Dugan during a stay at UCSF Benioff Children\\'s Hospital in San Francisco in April. Geissinger\\'s son Ollie\\'s health problems, including heart and intestinal issues, have kept them in and out of the hospital since his birth. The healthy flush seeped from Ollie’s chubby legs. His lips tinged blue, then violet. The medical machinery surrounding his bassinet went from making languid pinging noises to something much more urgent. Melissa called for the nurse. It was just before Labor Day, and they were back at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital in San Francisco for the third time. One week earlier, surgeons had spliced the living section of Ollie’s large intestine with his stomach and removed his ileostomy, a fleshy circle of pink tissue poking from his belly. Ollie had used a colostomy bag almost since birth. The operation had gone well. “Is this the surprise?” Cole asked himself. Ollie’s plumbing finally worked. Melissa and Cole practiced changing his diaper. It was easier than cleaning the plastic bag taped to his stomach, which sometimes leached stinking liquid and required two sets of hands to change. They were about to be discharged. Then Ollie caught a cold. Ollie’s heart has only one ventricle instead of two, so oxygen saturation levels in his blood are 75 to 85 percent of normal, and will be until he has a more invasive heart operation as a toddler. Now, that figure was plummeting. Sixty percent. Forty percent. Cole caressed the baby’s fontanel, trying to calm him down. He wanted to hold his son against his chest and rock him and kiss his cheeks, but the baby was covered in tape and tubes. Ollie cried louder, tears seeping from the corners of his slitted eyes. The sight tore at Cole. Thirty percent. Doctors rushed into the room. “We need to sedate him right now,” one said. It was taking too long. Melissa’s heart hammered in her chest. A dozen people in scrubs were crammed into their room in the annex of the cardiac intensive care unit. The doctors were vacillating on which narcotic to inject. They spoke in jargon, and she caught only snippets of sentences. “Intubation,” someone said. Nineteen percent. Oxygen deprivation can cause brain damage. Eventually, the body shuts down, tissues suffocate and die, and the damage becomes irreversible. Ollie wasn’t getting enough oxygen. He was too worked up to get a full breath of air. Melissa felt something inside of her break. She backed out of the room, away from her husband and the cluster of doctors and nurses scrambling to save her son’s life. She slumped on the tile floor in the hallway. It was cold. But she couldn’t cry — she felt numb, like her system had short-circuited. Moments of light were so ephemeral. Days before, everything had seemed perfect. But Melissa knew perfection had an expiration date. Her stomach would tighten with dread, ruining even the happiest of days. Maybe she wasn’t entitled to joy. The darkness always returned. Henry Granger pauses for a moment while exercising at 24 Hour Fitness in Santa Rosa in September. When Henry had first moved to California, the siren song of the ocean called him. He drove up Highway 1 near Monterey, pulled off at a random exit and walked to the water’s edge. The blue was vast and endless. It overwhelmed him. Waves lapped at his feet, soaking the hem of his pants. In all his travels, his path had ended here. Not Washington or Oregon or Canada, like he had once dreamed. California. “This is it,” he thought. “This is as far as I can go.” He retired from the military soon after, in 1981. He no longer craved adventure — not the way he had when he was 18 and enlisted in the Army to escape the segregated South. His parents were sharecroppers and had raised Henry and his seven siblings in Homewood, Ala., 5 miles outside of Birmingham. They were a good, churchgoing family. His father was a deacon, and his three sisters sang in the choir. But there were few opportunities for a black man in the town of 25,000 people. Henry could play only at certain parks, swim in certain pools and enroll in a certain high school. He got his first job at 15, as a houseboy for a white family. He scrubbed their floors and cut their grass, saving his money and buying a car before his own father did. And then Henry left, never looking back. Henry Granger grabs a tool box from his car after arriving at his new home in Windsor in July. More than 8 months after the Tubbs Fire destroyed their home in Santa Rosa, the Grangers finally have a home of their own. Henry and Astrid Granger work together while changing the lock on the front door of their new home in Windsor. As a tank soldier, he had fired nearly every military weapon and driven most of the Army’s vehicles. As a husband, he had paid off the mortgage on his Coffey Park home and bought Astrid a new one in Windsor. As a fire survivor, he had grappled with trauma and made peace with it. “Living in Coffey Park and all that, you think, ‘This is it,’” he said. “We never realized the fire was going to come and take everything. Never did anyone in a million think the fire would jump the freeway and come our way.” Now, he felt himself reaching the end of the line. As September returned with its fierce summer blue, and the one-year anniversary of the Tubbs Fire approached, Henry and Astrid settled into their new home. It was just a small place, nothing pretentious, but decent. They celebrated Henry’s 78th birthday. Their lives had regained rhythm and purpose. Different from before, but fuller and better. They were settled. It was enough. “We didn’t think we would make it,” Henry said. “But we did.” This was as far as they could go. Melissa Geissinger holds son Ollie at her parents’ home in Sebastopol in August. Desperation pulled them west, where it was calmer, and they followed on a whim. Melissa looked up rental properties online. Ollie was healthy again, growing chubbier and more expressive with the passing days. He shimmied side-to-side to songs by the rock band Thrice and loved hugging his stuffed bunny named Bash. The 9-month-old had survived the latest hospital scare, and there was no lasting damage from the oxygen deprivation. All of them needed a respite. Melissa and Cole had loved living in Sebastopol with her parents, where they felt both safe and sad. But nearly a year had passed since the fire, and they wanted their independence. Ollie Geissinger grips his mother’s fingers. They were rebuilding in Coffey Park, even though money for their home remained in flux. Ollie’s surgeries still hadn’t been tabulated and billed by their insurance. Melissa and Cole applied for state funding earmarked to help pay the medical bills of chronically sick children. It would be another year, probably more, before they could move back to Santa Rosa. They couldn’t stay with her parents that long. With so many people crammed in a small space, conflict brewed. One afternoon, Melissa lost her temper and screamed so loud that her mother thought she would have to grab Ollie and head somewhere, just for a while until Melissa cooled off. It was time for them to leave. On Zillow, Melissa spotted a beachfront listing in Bodega Bay. It was 25 minutes from her parents’ home. Its windows looked out on the coastline, south to Point Reyes. The water was beautiful and blue. It was endless. Kenny Crain (left) helps his brother-in-law, Cole Geissinger, move into a Bodega Bay rental home in August.  “What the hell,” she thought. “Let’s go check it out.” Cutting through Sonoma County on the drive to the ocean, Melissa felt a sense of peace that had eluded her for nearly a year. Cole was excited — more excited than he had been in months. Where would their grocery store be? Would they host parties? It was a fever dream. It seemed unreal that they would actually move to the coast. But they fell in love with the house. It felt like a sanctuary, with its soft carpets and hazy morning light. Two days later, they signed a lease. Insurance money would pay rent for the next year. After that, they would figure something out until construction of their home was complete. “It feels too good to be true,” Melissa said. “I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like, no, the universe still hates you. I’d like to think we have wrapped up enough karma for something to go our way.” For once, it had. On an early autumn morning, she sat on the back porch, looking out over the water, cradling Ollie in her lap. She and Cole planned to renew their vows soon. Maybe right here, with a few friends. The fog blew across the coast. Seagulls flew through the air. They had come so far. They had survived. Cole Geissinger holds his son, Ollie, as he looks out at the ocean view from the deck of their rental home in Bodega Bay. One year ago, more than a dozen fires shot to life in the North Bay. One of them, the Tubbs Fire, would become the most destructive wildfire in California history, killing 24 people and incinerating entire neighborhoods in and around Santa Rosa. One of those was Coffey Park. Henry and Astrid Granger, who had lived there for 30 years, and Melissa and Cole Geissinger, residents for just two years, survived the fire but lost all they had. In the year since the fire, The Chronicle’s Lizzie Johnson has spent hundreds of hours with the two couples to report this story, witnessing some of the most intimate, heartbreaking and joyous moments as they rebuilt their lives.

That’s the view of Supervisor  Hillary Ronen . So Ronen introduced legislation at the Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday that would require the airport to change its design and grace the renovated Terminal 1 with the words “Harvey Milk Terminal” in big, bold letters. The SFO Airport Commission’s proposal includes a large sign that says “Terminal 1,” with “Harvey Milk Terminal” written in much smaller font underneath. “This is not acceptable,” Ronen said. “The exterior signage is important because it is one of the first things that visitors coming to the airport will see. The entire point of the terminal renaming is to elevate Harvey Milk’s legacy, not have it mentioned as a footnote.” The board unanimously approved an ordinance last year to name Terminal 1 after Milk, the city’s first openly gay supervisor. Ronen sponsored the ordinance, which was a modified version of a charter amendment that former Supervisor  David Campos  proposed in 2013. SFO spokesman  Doug Yakel  said the airport “is working to ensure the exterior design of Terminal 1 fully reflects the Board of Supervisors’ efforts and intentions.” — Trisha Thadani Good morning, Bay Area.  It’s Feb. 20, and one restaurant found out that traffic delays on the way to Tahoe can really set people on edge. Here’s what you need to know to start your day. In Arizona with the A’s How did you become interested in baseball? I loved it from the first time my dad explained it to me when I was 6. The timing was good: It was 1972 and we had just moved to Alameda from Guam, and the A’s were starting their run of three championships in a row. But it was more the way my dad described it. He didn’t dumb it down, he explained how each pitch mattered and affected the ones that would come after, why pitchers might throw a strike or a ball in a given count. It captured me immediately. Like what you’re reading? Subscribe to The Chronicle’s  Bay Briefing newsletter  and get the Bay Area’s best journalism in your inbox every weekday. You’ve been covering the A’s since 1999. What’s changed for the team since then? Strangely, not that much, because Billy Beane has been running the show the entire time and his front office always has to do more with less. They are always on the cheap side but creative, which is fun to cover. Most of the changes have been with baseball itself. There is more money than ever, and the financial discrepancies between the teams are greater. Games take longer than ever. Attendance and ratings are dipping. What does a normal work day entail? I spend at least eight hours a day at the ballpark for a six-month season and six weeks of spring training. We get there four to five hours before the game and have clubhouse access to talk to players. Then we talk to the manager during batting practice and run back to the press box to write pregame posts and try to grab dinner. We file a quick game story right when the game ends — then run down to talk to the manager and players to update our stories with quotes on what is very often a tight, tight deadline with night games. I’m also almost always working on feature stories for off days and working on other things as podcasts. It’s a long, busy day. What are some of the stories and themes you’re watching for at spring training? The A’s still don’t have a complete rotation, so they’ll need to add some starting pitchers. Four members of last year’s eventual rotation were acquired from March on. There are also a number of starting pitchers rehabbing from injuries, including prominent figures such as Sean Manaea and top prospect A. J. Puk. Their progress will be watched closely by the team, media and fans. For readers who aren’t dedicated A’s or baseball fans  —  what stories do you think have wider relevance for Bay Area readers? The A’s are the classic No. 2 (in this market, behind the Giants). Longtime A’s fans get frustrated that the team trades major players frequently, but it’s the reality of a team that doesn’t command its own marketplace and that doesn’t have a new or enticing building to play in. Should the A’s  ever get a new ballpark , that should interest even the non-sports fans in the area — it’s sure to be spectacular and intensely fan-friendly and forward-thinking. Fights, feces, food shortages “They say civilization is just five hot meals from cannibalism and murder. That was the case on Friday,” says Kim McCarthy, the co-owner of 50 Grand restaurant and bar in Pollock Pines. As traffic snarled along routes to Tahoe on Friday night following dangerous snow conditions, the mountain town restaurant became the only place for hot meals and bathroom access along Highway 50. Overwhelmed and understaffed, Friday at 50 Grand started with a man getting out of his car to punch another driver in the face and ended with someone defecating in front of the restaurant. Reporter Justin Phillips tells about  one restaurant’s very, very long weekend in the Tahoe snow traffic snarl . A long wait for taxis More than half of the San Francisco taxi drivers say the city’s transportation agency is treating them as second-class citizens. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency imposed new rules this month that give San Francisco International Airport pick-up preferences to 558 drivers who bought $250,000 medallions under a program that started about 10 years ago. The move is intended to stave off bankruptcies for those who financed the purchase of the medallion with loans — a common occurrence as taxis face stiff competition from ride-hailing services. But that means those who waited years for their medallions are largely locked out of the lucrative airport fares. Carolyn Said talks to  those on the wrong end of the policy change . About turn The Raiders appear to be close to wrapping up a deal to keep the team playing at the Oakland Coliseum this year and possibly in 2020,  columnist Phil Matier reports . The team walked away from a one-year, $7.5-million lease extension at the Coliseum in December after the city of Oakland joined a lawsuit seeking millions in damages for the team’s move to Las Vegas. So is a Coliseum season going to happen after all that? “I’d say there is a better than 50-50 shot,” Coliseum Authority board member Chris Dobbins says.

In the Studio The San Francisco City Insider podcast recently got out of the studio and onto the streets of San Francisco. Columnist Heather Knight followed volunteers from Miracle Messages, who ask the city’s homeless if there’s anyone with whom they’d like to reconnect — and deliver a short video message to. Using volunteer “digital detectives,” they’ve sparked 194 reunions so far. Listen in as columnist Heather Knight walks along with Beverly Stevenson  as she tries to help a man who’s been living on the streets for seven years.After singing her way through Drake High School in San Anselmo and making it through several elimination rounds on “American Idol,” Kelli Peterson moved to Hawaii to record and perform her own style of soul-reggae under the stage name Kelli Love. She built a $15,000 studio behind her rented home in the town of Puna, on the Big Island of Hawaii, and was working on her third album when the volcano on the island erupted on May 3. When the evacuation order came, Peterson fled with her two young boys, two guitars, a ukulele and some recording gear but had to leave behind her keyboard and piano and amplifiers. They each packed a small suitcase but left behind all the furniture, art and possessions. Everything but Peterson’s dream was locked in lava and gone for good as she bought one-way tickets home to San Francisco to start over. Founded:  1986 Total cash distributed:  Nearly $130 million Number of individuals and families helped:  More than 150,000 (approximately 4,500 individuals and families annually) Total cash distributed to food banks:  More than $21 million Number of annual donors:   Approximately 5,800 “We were literally in the path of the volcano,” said Peterson, a single mom. “We had to evacuate and come home in a crisis, to Marin, where I have family.” One reason she had left home is that the cost of housing in Marin made Hawaii cheap by comparison. But in her three years away, Bay Area housing costs had taken off, and now she struggled to find a place she could afford to rent. At first, she was moving the kids back and forth from her aunt’s place in Fairfax to her mom’s place in Cotati while also working to scrape up enough money to get into a place of her own. “I’m working three different freelance jobs doing social media and marketing, working at night after I finally get the kids to bed,” she said. “I’m trying to get the money together, and every time I check Craigslist, the rents keep rising. In Marin, it could be $7,500 that someone needs to come up with just to get into a place.” Peterson was out of money, but the thing she still had was her car, a Toyota Camry that she’d left behind years ago. She drove in search of housing, and was all the way to Point Reyes Station when she ran out of options and found herself at West Marin Community Services, a nonprofit agency. That’s when her luck finally started to turn after five bad months. Program manager Martha Martinez helped her gain assistance through The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing Fund. With a grant to cover her deposit and first month’s rent, she was able to lease an apartment in Highlands of Marin, a hillside complex just east of Highway 101 in San Rafael. Peterson, 35, and her boys Kín, 5, and Che, 1, share a one-bedroom. Because they had no furniture, Peterson went online looking for curb giveaways. She got lucky there, too. A man in San Anselmo was remodeling and dumping his living room set. Peterson had no way to haul it all so the man loaded it on his truck and delivered it. Now she is sitting on a gifted $3,000 sofa from Pottery Barn. There ought to be a song in that. As a writer, Peterson resists the cliche that she has come full circle, but it is true that her earliest memories are of going to the Marin Civic Center, one exit to the south, to watch her maternal grandfather, Peter Allen Smith, preside over the Superior Court. “I just love that Frank Lloyd Wright building,” she said. “It’s really beautiful and nostalgic for me.” Her mother, Anne Marie Smith, is an oncology nurse at Kaiser Permanente, which is even closer. “It’s a blessing for all of us,” Peterson said. Peterson is the oldest of five siblings. By age 16 she was singing with the Bay Area funk-reggae band About Face. She sang a solo at her Sir Francis Drake high school graduation ceremony in 2001. By the time she graduated from UCLA, in 2006, she’d adopted the stage name Kelli Love. She was also on MTV’s “Making the Band” in 2005. She was writing songs for TV and film, doing session work. In 2009, she earned a songwriting credit for “Who’s Gonna Love You Now,” on an album by Randy Jackson, a producer and judge on “American Idol.” “What made me move to Hawaii is that I wanted to change gears and make a go of it as an independent artist,” she said. Last winter, Kelli Love sang with Eli Mac to open for Lauryn Hill at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center, she said. Songs  from her CDs are on soundcloud.com . As Kelli Peterson, she had a job on an event production team. Now she doesn’t even have a piano, though she couldn’t fit one into her apartment anyway. She also doesn’t have a table to eat on, and the only quiet place for her to play her guitar is out on the back patio. Kelli Love has not yet started to sing about fleeing the volcano, but she can feel it starting to come. “I’m getting the kids into school and programs in this area, which will give me more time to find more work and re-establish myself here,” she said. “I’d like to start a new album in the spring.”Flabbergasted by recent reports of San Francisco General Hospital sending huge bills to some privately insured patients, a Board of Supervisors committee held a hearing Thursday to determine how the city can treat insured patients more fairly. The Department of Public Health is working on ways it can add more transparency to its billing practices and presented some of those findings to the Government Audit and Oversight Committee. The hearing came one week after Mayor London Breed and the department halted the practice of balance billing — sending patients bills if their private insurance companies don’t pay the charges — for 90 days. At issue is San Francisco General’s policy of not entering into contracts with private insurance companies. Instead, the hospital charges the maximum rates approved each year by the mayor and Board of Supervisors. The patient’s insurance company decides how much it wants to pay, with the patient billed for the rest. That has left patients with exorbitant bills — some that reach into the tens of thousands of dollars — for common ailments like broken bones or appendicitis. “As we’ve had more attention on this issue, it is clear that this practice does not reflect our values and the way we want our patients to experience the hospital,” said Greg Wagner, chief financial officer for the Department of Public Health, which oversees the hospital. Wagner said DPH is considering a cap on out-of-pocket expenses that a lower-income, insured patient would have to pay. Other proposals include new administrative procedures on how to assess patient eligibility for financial support before they are billed and increasing the hospital’s financial assistance programs. Supervisor Aaron Peskin called for the hearing after numerous reports on  Vox  and in  The Chronicle  revealed details of the hospital’s billing practices. “Balance billing is part of a larger issue of what is, quite frankly, a screwed-up patchwork of national health care coverage,” Peskin said. “We have to take the patients out of the middle.” Since the issue has come to light, Peskin said his email inbox has been flooded with reports of people receiving bills for tens of thousands of dollars, despite the fact that they have insurance. One of them was Nicki Pogue, a 50-year-old who was hit with a $13,700 bill after going to the hospital for a viral syndrome. Her insurance only covered about $3,600, leading her to believe that she would have been better off if she hadn’t been insured. “During my intake, I was never informed that I would have received a bill like this,” she said. “I received excellent care there, but its billing practices are an embarrassment for our city.” San Francisco General has defended its billing practices by saying many of its patients are on Medicare or Medi-Cal, or have no insurance at all. A hospital spokesman told Vox, “We feel like we have to recoup what we’re able to from people who are insured because we’re supporting people who don’t have insurance.” Wagner pushed against the comment in Vox on Thursday. While he admitted the hospital needs to re-evaluate how it deals with insured patients, he said the department does not “charge patients rates to subsidize anyone else.” The department will present the board with more specific solutions in the next few months. In the meantime, people like 32-year-old Michal Kaczmarski are stuck fighting bills that they worry will throw them into debt. In August, Kaczmarski went to the hospital in the middle of the night with a debilitating stomachache. After a number of blood tests, he was told to rest and take some Tylenol. Then he received a $9,000 bill — only $2,500 of which his insurance would cover. “Had I known that I was going to a place that charges a crazy amount, I wouldn’t have gone,” he said.Many years ago, when his body was strong and the paychecks flowed, Jose Rios-Estrada built cabinets. He shaped oak and mahogany with his saws and hammers, and the shelves and doors he created went into camper vans and wineries all around the Napa Valley. Rios’ hands were sure, and he had a wife who loved him, a baby boy and a house. But that was many years ago. The end to the cabinetmaking started small, like so many sad things. Then it grew to monstrous proportions that at times seemed like too much to bear. But in that challenge came strength, new life, greater faith — and a deeper understanding that sometimes, when you’ve just about given up, help can come from places where you’d never expect it. The trouble began one day in 1995 when Rios woke up with double vision. That went away after a few days. Then there was a bit of dizziness — which by the end of the year became a lot of dizziness, so much that he could barely walk. And that’s when the doctors told him he had a disease he’d barely even heard of before. It was called multiple sclerosis, and it was going to end his career, they said. It did end his career, and in a few short years he and his family lost their house in Napa and moved into an apartment across town. But Rios and his wife, Josefina Calderon, and their son, Christian Rios, are built of strong stuff. So it didn’t end them. “Why be mad about what has happened?” Rios said, sitting at the dining room table recently as he carefully drew a helicopter in a sketchbook he keeps with him to keep his hands exercised to prevent them from seizing up. “There is nothing you can do, so it is God’s will.” Founded:  1986 Total cash distributed:  Nearly $130 million Number of individuals and families helped:  More than 150,000 (approximately 4,500 individuals and families annually) Total cash distributed to food banks:  More than $21 million Number of annual donors:  Approximately 5,800 For the past 32 years, The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing Fund has helped more than 150,000 Bay Area individuals and families facing unexpected life crises. The idea of neighbors helping neighbors was introduced to The Chronicle in 1986 by the late Walter A. Haas Jr. and Ira Hirschfield, president of the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund. Since then, the Season of Sharing Fund has distributed nearly $130 million to help those living in the Bay Area. Each year, the fund provides temporary assistance to about 4,500 individuals and families, allocating most of its grants for housing needs as well as paying for other critical necessities such as wheelchairs or essential furniture for families recovering from fires. Grants are paid directly to the suppliers of services, such as landlords. Individuals do not receive direct grants from the Season of Sharing Fund. The fund, which also distributes more than $1 million each year to local food banks, relies on donations from readers. The money is distributed year-round. Every penny of your donation goes to help those who need it most. All expenses are covered by the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund and The Chronicle. We are proud to say that since the fund’s inception, 100 percent of the money raised has gone directly to help the families and communities we serve.

Calderon — who like her husband is 51 — handed him a newly sharpened pencil to fill in the finer detail of the helicopter’s rotor. He smiled up at her and patted her hand. “In the first couple of years I didn’t want to go out, or use the wheelchair,” Rios said. “But then you get used to it. This is our life. And it is good.” That attitude permeates their small apartment, a study in neatness and placidity. Every wall features a picture of either Jesus, Mary, an angel or members of their huge extended family. A 3-foot-tall statue of Mary stands in the hallway, with an open Bible at her feet, and on the wall, over Rios’s head, is a painting of Jesus alongside a prayer. “I like this one a lot,” said Calderon, touching the prayer on the wall after she helped her husband into bed for a rest. She read the words — “I put my hands on you, whatever you want to do with me, I thank you” — then fell silent a moment. “We do pray a lot,” she said quietly. “And God listens.” One of those times God listened, she said, came not long ago when the couple was just about out of hope. In October 2017, Rios developed an infection that landed him in hospitals and skilled nursing homes for months as a series of follow-up problems hit, from open bedsores to a seizure. It wasn’t until the following July that he was able to finally go home — but by then, he was so weakened that he couldn’t get out of bed. Calderon couldn’t physically lift him. She suffers from carpal tunnel, dislocated spinal discs and other physical complications from the housecleaning and winery production work she did before leaving work behind in 2005 to take care of Rios. She’s able to do all the things a home health aide does — make the meals, get her husband in and out of his wheelchair and bed, and more. But she needs him to help just a bit. So when he couldn’t even sit up in his bed, she was at her wits’ end. Their son, friends and family helped — but they couldn’t do it 24-7. That presented a dilemma. Medi-Cal won’t pay Calderon for her home health-aide role. Nor will it supply a full-time aide so she could explore other work. So the couple lives entirely on Rios’ $1,350 monthly federal disability check and a government subsidy to help with rent. The thing they needed most, but could not afford, was a $3,800 lifting machine to help Rios out of bed. “That kind of money, for us, would be like buying a car. Impossible,” Calderon said. “Then we heard about the Care Network that helps people with problems like ours.” And that led to The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing, which provides one-time funds to people in need. Calling Care Network, which helps low-income people with medical needs, put the couple in touch with the nonprofit’s social worker Maria Puentes — who contacted Season of Sharing. In two weeks, the device was at Rios’ bedside. “It’s amazing. It saved us,” said Calderon. “God and Season of Sharing answered our prayers.” Lately, even more good news has come their way. A few months ago, Rios got prescribed Ocrevus, a relatively new drug that helps prevent MS from worsening — and he’s responded so well that he has begun to be able to get out of bed at times without the lift. The machine is still crucial, but with Rios feeling peppier, he’s been doing more arm exercises and feels stronger. “Jose is a very sweet guy, always a big smile on his face,” Puentes said. “And both of them — they are so upbeat. A lot of that has to do with their family support and their faith. But just on their own, their attitude is really something.” The typical day in the Rios-Calderon household is filled with sketching, laughing, reading, and watching soccer and movies on TV. On the weekends, there is church. Their son is 22 and in his final year of study for a degree in physical therapy at San Francisco State University. So he’s gone every day. At home, the couple occupies each other with the little things. Everyday things, which for a long-married couple that loves each other is plenty, they say. There’s not much sitting around feeling sorry about things because too much has actually gone right for them, they’ll tell you. They both grew up poor in Mexico and immigrated to America in 1981 for a better life, and after meeting at a night-school class in English they got married. They became citizens. They worked. Rios played in a soccer league — he has a “Most Valuable Player” tournament trophy on a shelf from the 1980s — until his legs gave out. When it’s holiday time, like now, there are sisters and brothers and parents to fill the house with chatter, children, and cheer. “We are blessed,” Calderon said. “And that goes extra for me,” said Rios. “I love everything about my wife — she is smart, kind and if it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t be here today.” He pumped his fist and grinned. “Our life? No problem!” he said.Mayor London Breed’s  State of the City address last week  was packed with plans, and one of them in particular grabbed my attention. She proposed a charter amendment for the November ballot that would make it easier to build 100 percent affordable housing projects — teacher housing included. If a proposed project fit the city’s zoning regulations and other requirements, it would get the green light. There would be no appeal, no way for angry neighbors to block it. “If an affordable housing or teacher housing project is proposed within zoning, then build it,” Breed said in her address. “Build it now. No more bureaucracy. No more costly appeals. No more ‘not in my neighborhood.’” It’s about time. This city has given far too much credence to complaining residents who apparently think time should stop once they move into a neighborhood. And then they complain when the resulting housing shortage means their priced-out friends keep leaving the city, their children’s teachers keep quitting and there are homeless people living on the sidewalks outside their front doors. Even if Breed’s proposal becomes law, San Francisco won’t exactly be building housing at the speed of light. Far from it. Her announcement serves as a good time to check in on the incredibly slow, but steady pace of the building of the city’s first, and still only, teacher housing development. It is still in the planning stages at 1360 43rd Ave., which is school district property. After officials with the school district, teachers union and Mayor’s Office of Housing talked for ages about possibly, maybe someday building teacher housing with no real progress,  the late Mayor Ed Lee had had enough . In May 2017, he announced he had chosen the Outer Sunset site and was allotting $44 million to the project. “There is a level of frustration I have with the current conversation,” Lee said back then. “We have an immediate housing problem right now.” So a year and nine months later, are teachers moving in? Yeah, right — not even close. The chosen developer, MidPen Housing, submitted its preliminary plans to the Planning Department in November and expects to get approvals in about a year, according to Kate Hartley, director of the Mayor’s Office of Housing. She said groundbreaking should take place late next year or early 2021. Construction should be finished in September 2022, after which teachers can move in to 130 new units. So, let’s recap: Even when the mayor finds money and selects a site, it still takes more than five years until anybody can actually move in. As for future teacher housing sites, maybe Mayor Breed needs to pull a move like her predecessor did and just pick one, because there’s been no progress on that front. Deputy Superintendent Myong Leigh said Monday the school district will issue within a month a request for qualifications from developers and other possible partners to help it explore the pluses and minuses of building housing on any particular site. There are several vacant, district-owned sites being considered, including the vacant lot at Seventh Avenue and Lawton Street in the Inner Sunset. It’s best known as Clancy’s pumpkin patch and Christmas tree farm. Supervisor Sandra Lee Fewer said she’s been asking the Mayor’s Office of Housing for two years to look at redeveloping a district-owned site near 30th Avenue and Balboa Street into teacher housing. It currently houses the Richmond Neighborhood Center, and Fewer believes it could be rebuilt to house the center and teacher apartments above. “At the very least, the city should be doing a feasibility study,” Fewer said, adding she’s gotten no traction on the idea. Hartley said the city’s preference is to develop vacant land. At Fewer’s proposed site, the neighborhood center would have to be moved during construction, and the building would probably be considered a historic resource — meaning a full environmental impact report would be required, Hartley said. It’s important to develop teacher housing in one of the world’s most expensive cities, but the slow pace demonstrates why it’s also crucial to raise teacher salaries in the meantime. There’s still no agreement at City Hall over whether any of the $185 million in windfall money leftover from an education account should go to — you know — education, in the form of teacher pay. Breed wants to spend it all on homeless services, while some supervisors and the school district want  $60 million to go to ensuring the raises teachers  got this year because of a voter-approved parcel tax don’t disappear while the measure is challenged in court. The Chronicle crunched teacher salary data for all California school districts for the 2017-18 academic year and found that a San Francisco teacher in his or her 10th year of teaching and with a bachelor’s degree and 60 extra college units makes $77,010 annually — 236th out of 792 districts statewide. That’s a lot better  than when we  first started crunching these figures three years ago  — an improved teacher contract helped that — but it’s still below districts in much more affordable cities such has Merced, Salida (Stanislaus County) and Rancho Cucamonga (San Bernardino County). San Francisco’s spot on the list should rise quite a bit next year, if the raises ranging from $4,000 to $6,000 from the disputed parcel tax stay in place. Susan Solomon, president of the teachers union, said her members are finally feeling more stable. A teacher at Visitacion Valley Middle School, for example, told Solomon she was able to quit her side job at Starbucks after receiving the raise. Another teacher told Solomon that, at age 55, she’s finally not in the red every month. Jennifer Moless is a kindergarten teacher at Serra Elementary School in Bernal Heights and was named Teacher of the Year by the mayor in 2013. She and her husband, who works at the post office, were able to buy a tenancy-in-common in Visitacion Valley during the economic downturn, but hadn’t felt stable until her pay raise this year. “It was a big relief,” she said. “For the first time, when the car broke down, we could fix it without using credit. We can take our cat to the vet and not worry about it.” These aren’t luxuries by any means, and anybody teaching children in San Francisco should be able to afford them. Losing her parcel tax bump would be “an insult,” she said. “If I commute, I could make considerably more money, and I’m choosing not to do that,” she said. “But taking a pay cut, I would have to wonder if my labor is actually useful.” It clearly is. And she and her colleagues need to be fairly paid for it. Chronicle staff writer Joaquin Palomino contributed to this story.City Attorney Dennis Herrera has long coveted the mayor’s office. He ran for the job in 2011 , finishing third behind winner Ed Lee and Supervisor John Avalos. A year ago,  he pulled papers to try to finish Lee’s second term  after  the mayor’s unexpected death , saying he was “seriously” considering jumping into last June’s election. He wound up not running. So nobody would have been all that surprised if Herrera tried again this November to unseat  Mayor London Breed  — and he would have been a formidable challenger. But he’s not running and instead will be on the November ballot to seek a sixth term representing the city of San Francisco in court. “I am not running for mayor,” he said during a recording of the  San Francisco City Insider podcast . Herrera’s decision is one fewer hurdle in Breed’s quest to claim a full four-year term. And, if city history is any guide, she’d have a leg up on claiming a second term for a total of nearly 10 years in Room 200. No name-brand candidates have pulled papers to challenge her. A walk through City Hall Monday morning to see if anybody had heard of any serious contenders pondering a campaign turned up nothing. The progressives, who couldn’t even get it together to smoothly  elect a board president this month , haven’t found anybody to challenge her. The deadline to file candidacy papers is June 11. “Short of the sky falling” Breed will win re-election, said one progressive city insider. But why won’t Herrera run? In short, he says, because he really likes the current mayor. Since he won his job in 2001, he’s worked with four mayors: Willie Brown, Gavin Newsom, Lee and Breed. “The relationship I’ve had with London Breed is the best I’ve had with any of them,” Herrera said. “She has been nothing but collaborative. She’s reached out. She’s been a really wonderful partner. ... We’ve been mutually supportive in what we want to do.” Collaborative? Mutually supportive? Yes, this is the benefit of electing women to higher office. The country should try it sometime! (Herrera would support that — he’s backing  California Sen. Kamala Harris for president , saying, “She has the vision to lead, and no one should ever underestimate the toughness behind that smile.”) Herrera, 56, addressed his own political future as well as many other hot topics at City Hall in a wide-ranging interview. To hear our whole talk, listen to the podcast at  sfchronicle.com/insider . Here are some of the highlights: Proposition C:  You know that squeeze City Hall finds itself in? The one in which voters approved three tax initiatives — funding child care, teacher raises and homeless services — but can’t spend the money until court challenges are resolved? Yeah, that one. That’s Herrera’s fault. Not that he’d put it that way. A memo from Herrera’s office in October 2017  used a somewhat obscure California Supreme Court decision to tell the city’s Department of Elections that “it is very unlikely that the city ... retains the authority to require a two-thirds vote for initiative tax measures.” Herrera’s argument is that a tax measure placed on the ballot by politicians still needs two-thirds voter approval for passage, but measures that qualify through a voter signature drive only need a simple majority. “The logic was so clear based on what the Supreme Court said,” Herrera said. “We wanted to put out an opinion that was transparent, where our legal reasoning was out there for everybody to see.” The matter is expected to take years to settle in court. So is Breed giving Herrera any side-eye for putting her in this awkward position? Herrera laughed and said, “We call it like we see it.” Pacific Gas and Electric:  Herrera has never been shy in sharing his distaste for the utility. As the company approached  Tuesday’s bankruptcy protection filing,  he was even more adamant that City Hall should strongly consider powering the city itself. “I think the irresponsibility of PG&E over the last two decades has been astounding,” Herrera said. He said the current debate over whether public power is the right way forward is “a debate that needs to happen.” Breed this month asked the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission  to take three months to examine what a PG&E bankruptcy would mean for San Francisco. A PG&E spokeswoman said at the time that the company is “committed to working together with policymakers, regulators and all stakeholders to provide safe and reliable energy that our customers expect and deserve.” Climate change and the opioid crisis:  These are two of the biggest issues facing San Francisco and the nation, and Herrera’s taking them both on in court. In 2017 his office, as well as several other counties around the state,  sued some of the world’s biggest oil companies , including ExxonMobil, Shell and Chevron, over climate change. They argued that the companies knowingly produced the heat-trapping gases that are raising the world’s temperatures and causing sea level to rise. San Francisco lost its case and is appealing. Similarly, Herrera’s office  in December sued pharmaceutical companies , saying they deliberately misled doctors and the public about their products and are fueling the country’s opioid crisis. “Both of these industries have to take responsibility,” Herrera said. Mental illness:  Less than a month ago, Herrera’s office took control of civil conservatorship cases for the most seriously mentally ill people in our city. As a supervisor, Breed pushed to move those cases out of the district attorney’s office. Herrera thinks San Francisco needs to do far more. “Unfortunately, San Franciscans and people around this country always talk about the homeless problem,” he said. “Homelessness is a symptom. We have a mental health and drug addiction crisis in San Francisco.” He said the city should consider opening mental health hospitals to fill the gap left when the state shuttered its own decades ago, casting many severely mentally ill people out on the streets. “We as a society have failed them, and we need to step up,” he said. His future:  While he’s committed to seeking a sixth term as city attorney, he wouldn’t rule out trying for Room 200 again someday. But for now, he’s enjoying life with his wife and teenage son in their Dogpatch neighborhood, frequenting the Japanese restaurant Moshi Moshi and the Dogpatch Saloon. The family recently returned from a vacation in Vietnam and Cambodia. “I have a great job, and I’m able to do a lot of really good things where I am and still have a life,” he said. “I’ve always said I’d like to be mayor, so maybe someday I’ll do it again. Maybe I won’t.”Year after year, Patti Medina answered the phone at the Oakland unemployment office. She filled out forms for strangers laid off from work. Helping strangers was her job. She never figured she’d be the next person needing a stranger’s help. Until she was. In April, Medina’s 10-year-old daughter, A.F., came back from a school camping trip complaining of being tired. She was short of breath. She needed to lie down, and she wouldn’t get up. Something was wrong. The thing that was wrong was her heart. Girls who are 10, who love dancing and gymnastics and dogs, aren’t supposed to get something called myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle caused by infection. But A.F. did. It’s a long word that Medina said she can’t spell and never expected to experience. Medina, a single mother and a native of El Salvador, took A.F. to the local clinic. The clinic rushed A.F. to UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital, where doctors placed her in intensive care. There she stayed for six weeks and, for all that time, Medina did not leave her side. “It was traumatic,” she said. “It was nerve-racking. I stayed right there. What else could I do?” At the unemployment office, Medina’s duties occasionally require her to place a caller on hold, for a few minutes. But now Medina found her entire life being placed on hold, for months. She took a short leave from work, then extended it and extended it some more. After A.F. was released from the hospital and allowed to return to their home in the Allendale section of Oakland, she needed her mother’s around-the-clock supervision. The job at the unemployment office would have to wait. When the disability benefits stopped but the rent and the grocery bills didn’t, Medina found herself going deeper and deeper in the hole. She borrowed money from friends, until the friends could help no more. She charged groceries and other essentials to her credit card, until the card was maxed out. The landlord said he was sorry about the myocarditis but he wanted the rent. He also wanted the 10 percent rent increase that kicked in the same month that A.F. got sick. He said he had bills to pay, too. “It was quite interesting,” Medina said, “that all the time I was helping people on the phone, I never imagined I’d be the one needing help. I never thought I’d be saying to myself, ‘How can this be happening to me?’” Medina decided to declare bankruptcy. That’s something else she never expected to experience. She and her daughter were at serious risk of finding themselves on the street. And that’s when a caseworker told her about the Season of Sharing. Chronicle Season of Sharing Fund Founded:  1986 Total cash distributed:  Nearly $130 million Number of individuals and families helped:  More than 150,000 (approximately 4,500 individuals and families annually) Total cash distributed to food banks:  More than $21 million Number of annual donors:   Approximately 5,800 Helping strangers is what The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing does, too, providing one-time funds to people facing unexpected crises. Within days of hearing her story, the fund paid Medina’s rent bills for October and November. Not long ago, A.F. got well enough to go back to school and Medina arranged to go back to her job and start working shorter days so she could pick up A.F. after school and care for her in the afternoons. Slowly, things are getting better. Medina plans to share her and A.F.’s lodgings with her sister-in-law, to help cover the rent. And going back to work is helping her dig herself out of the kind of debt that comes with maxed-out credit cards. “The Season of Sharing helped me to breathe a little easier,” she said. “It gave us both a break. I’m extremely grateful. I don’t know what we would have done without it.” Next month, Medina said she plans to ask her boss at the unemployment office for a transfer. She wants to help people applying for disability benefits instead of unemployment benefits. She wants to help people like her. “Unemployment is bad enough, but disability is worse,” she said. “That’s about losing your health. There’s nothing worse than that.” Receiving help from strangers, she said, is going to make her a better unemployment office representative. Now she knows what it’s like to wait on hold, to not have your questions answered, to not talk to the people you need to talk to. “There’s so much runaround,” she said. “There’s so much stress. The next time I have to put someone on hold, when I get back on the line, I’m going to have the answers to their problem.” Just perhaps, she said, there may be something positive to come from her daughter’s illness. “Bad things are inevitable in life,” she said. “But maybe we can learn from them. Maybe I can be more sensitive and caring. I’m going to try.”Life usually changes for the worse when you fall off a ladder. Not always. For Dora Castillo, who fell from a ladder in 2002, things didn’t get worse at all. Even though she broke her foot, and even though she got fired from her job as a San Francisco hotel maid for breaking her foot — and at Christmas, too. Things got better, and kept getting better. Sixteen years later, they’re better than ever. “I’m a warrior,” said Castillo. “I keep going.” But she did get an initial step up from The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing. Castillo fell from a ladder while on the job cleaning a downtown hotel room. She didn’t tell the boss, because she was afraid of being fired, and it was nearing Christmas. But her boss found out and Castillo got fired anyway. Losing her job meant the single mother wasn’t able to pay the rent or buy Christmas presents for her 8-year-old daughter, Rina. Season of Sharing, which provides one-time funds to people facing unexpected crises, heard about her plight and paid two months back rent so that the Castillos could stay in their Mission District apartment. The food bank at the La Raza Community Resource Center of San Francisco helped out, too. For the past 32 years, The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing Fund has helped more than 150,000 Bay Area individuals and families facing unexpected life crises. The idea of neighbors helping neighbors was introduced to The Chronicle in 1986 by the late Walter A. Haas Jr. and Ira Hirschfield, president of the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund. Since then, the Season of Sharing Fund has distributed nearly $130 million to help those living in the Bay Area. Each year, the fund provides temporary assistance to about 4,500 individuals and families, allocating most of its grants for housing needs as well as paying for other critical necessities such as wheelchairs or essential furniture for families recovering from fires. Grants are paid directly to the suppliers of services, such as landlords. Individuals do not receive direct grants from the Season of Sharing Fund. The fund, which also distributes more than $1 million each year to local food banks, relies on donations from readers. The money is distributed year-round. Every penny of your donation goes to help those who need it most. All expenses are covered by the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund and The Chronicle. We are proud to say that since the fund’s inception, 100 percent of the money raised has gone directly to help the families and communities we serve.

Firefighters at a local station brought over a Christmas tree — the first tree the Castillo family ever had. “It was the best Christmas,” Rina said. “All because strangers helped.” Dora Castillo got back on her feet, figuratively and literally. After three years, she no longer needed to use a cane. She got another job, as a caregiver for San Francisco seniors. It’s a lot better than the hotel job, she said. And, as happens in stories like this , Rina didn’t stay 8 years old. Rina grew up. As she did, she remembered what can happen when strangers help strangers. As a kid, Rina had wanted to work with animals. Over the years, she changed her mind. In high school, she decided she wanted to go into social work. “I wanted to help other people because I saw what happened when other people helped us,” she said. Rina Castillo graduated with honors from UC Santa Cruz and got a job at Catholic Charities of San Francisco, in the Mission District. Her job is locating and interviewing people in the same fix that she and her mom were in 16 years ago. She has identified and helped pay the rent of scores of clients. “A lot of my clients have exactly the same story that my mother and I did,” she said. “They just need temporary help getting back on their feet.” Rina still lives with her mom in the Mission District, in a larger apartment unit. Dora is 50, Rina, 24. “My mom has always been there for me, and I’m always going to be there for her,” Rina said. “We’re stable now. That’s a nice word. Stable.” These days they go halves on the rent. They can afford Christmas presents and a tree. Dora leaves the house every day to run errands, clean and cook for an 83-year-old client in the Castro. And Rina goes to work at Catholic Charities where her boss, Mishell Monsoco, is the same caseworker who helped line up the Castillos’ Season of Sharing grant in 2002. Monsoco had stayed in touch with the Castillos over the years, helping them with legal advice and advice about colleges. When Rina, fresh out of UC Santa Cruz, came looking for a job, it was Monsoco who recommended that she be hired. “Rina is diligent,” Monsoco said. “She listens. She gives herself to people. She’s very sweet but she’s also very tough.” Rina Castillo is heading back to college soon, to get her master’s degree in social work, so she can “keep helping,” she said. “We all need help sometimes,” she said. “The Season of Sharing Fund was there for us when we needed it. I want to be there for people who need help, too.”   Distribution of funds   1986-June 2016 2016-17 2017-18 TOTAL $112,594,442 $7,938,750 $8,825,000 $129,358,192   Housing assistance /   critical family needs and food banks   County 1986- June 2016 2016-17 2017-18 TOTAL Alameda 21,679,695 1,508,362 1,623,550 24,811,607 Contra Costa 14,748,900 1,032,038 1,110,850 16,891,788 Marin 6,013,559 396,938 427,250 6,837,747 Napa 5,717,736 476,325 603,900 6,797,961 San Francisco 20,991,531 1,508,362 1,623,550 24,123,443 San Mateo 12,686,768 793,875 854,500 14,335,143 Santa Clara 17,532,760 1,270,200 1,367,200 20,170,160 Solano 6,419,983 476,325 522,700 7,419,008 Sonoma 6,789,411 476,325 691,500 7,957,236 Total $112,594,442* 7,938,750 8,825,000 $129,358,192* Generally, 85 percent of the total funds are distributed for housing assistance and critical family needs, and the remaining 15percent is allocated to food banks for emergency food services.

Methamphetamine overdose deaths doubled over the past decade, even as opioid fatalities stabilized; more people die from methamphetamine use than heroin in San Francisco. Meth-related emergency room visits skyrocketed more than 1,200 percent from about 150 in 2008 to nearly 2,000 in 2016. Treating people who are having bad reactions to the drug — suffering extreme paranoia or hallucinations, for example, or exhibiting aggressive behavior — at times strains police and psychiatric services. In response to what’s being perceived as a growing threat with few clear solutions, San Francisco is putting together a methamphetamine task force, which will begin meeting this spring and intends to put out a report this fall. The task force will be co-chaired by Mayor London Breed and Supervisor Rafael Mandelman and include representatives from public health, addiction research and the community of methamphetamine users. “The data is showing us that as opioid use is tapering off — even though it’s still a real challenge — methamphetamine is on the rise, and we need to address that,” Breed said in an interview Thursday. “This is why we decided to put together a task force for the purposes of bringing all parties to the table to come up with solutions.” Methamphetamine is a synthetic stimulant that is typically smoked, snorted or injected. Long-term use can cause brain damage. People who overdose can become combative and unpredictable, and they may feel urges to harm themselves or others. Overdose deaths happen when methamphetamine causes sudden heart failure or bleeding of the brain’s main blood vessels. Also, methamphetamine can be spiked with the synthetic opioid fentanyl, which can cause fatal respiratory failure in even small doses. About 100 people died from methamphetamine overdoses in 2017, compared with about 150 from all types of opioids, according to a San Francisco sentinel center that is part of the National Drug Early Warning System. Numbers for 2018 are expected this year, but public health officials don’t expect the statistics to change dramatically, said Dr. Phillip Coffin, director of substance use research with the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Currently, roughly half of all visits to the psychiatric emergency department at San Francisco General Hospital are because of methamphetamine intoxication, said Dr. Anton Nigusse Bland, medical director of psychiatric emergency services. “When a person is using methamphetamine, they can look essentially like a person who’s suffering with a severe mental illness like schizophrenia,” Bland said. “They’re running around, they’re anxious, they may be taking their clothes off, they may be yelling at the top of their lungs. They often are not caring for themselves adequately, and they may look malnourished and disheveled.” The treatments for methamphetamine intoxication and psychotic episodes are often similar, too, he said. Patients generally are given antianxiety drugs such as Valium and a calm, quiet place to recover. Sometimes it becomes clear that they’re suffering from methamphetamine use — not mental illness — only after 12 hours or so, when they’ve sobered up. That’s important because the city has limited services for people with serious mental health issues. The emergency psychiatric unit at San Francisco General has 18 beds and is almost always at capacity. Many of the patients treated in the psychiatric emergency department are homeless, which can make them more vulnerable to drug use and also complicate both their short- and long-term treatment, public health experts said. “Our public health challenges are made worse because of the easy access to meth,” Mandelman said. “It’s a very cheap drug. And if you’re homeless and on the street and you’re having to stay awake or just get through a really hard time, increasingly people are turning to meth. That exacerbates all the other problems we have around homelessness.” Unlike with opioids, there are almost no evidence-based treatment programs to help people stop using methamphetamine, and no emergency drugs like naloxone to reverse life-threatening overdoses. The task force will prioritize creative solutions to reducing death and injury caused by methamphetamine use, Mandelman and Breed said. That could mean developing programs similar to safe-injection sites, where people could smoke or inject methamphetamine in an environment where they have immediate access to care if something goes wrong. Solutions also could include more programs like San Francisco General’s Hummingbird Place — a respite center for people who are recovering from drug or mental health crises — and addiction treatment programs that focus more on harm reduction than abstinence. Researchers also are looking into medications that could help people quit methamphetamine — an option that so far has proved elusive. “For the opioid issue we have treatments that have stood the test of time,” Bland said. “With methamphetamine use, we still are collecting data. We don’t have a plethora of really well studied, highly effective treatments.” One other priority for the task force should be addressing stigma around drug use, which can block people’s access to care, whether they’re in the midst of an overdose or want help quitting or cutting back their use, Bland said. Among the few treatment programs that have consistently shown results in helping people scale back their use involve paying participants to reinforce positive behaviors. The San Francisco AIDS Foundation has such a program, called the Positive Reinforcement Opportunity Project, specifically targeting methamphetamine use. It also has the Stonewall Project, a harm reduction program for all types of drug and alcohol use. The programs are effective, said leaders with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. But they depend on community support. “Stigma can be a barrier to a lot of these interventions,” said Mike Discepola, director of the Stonewall Project. “We need partnerships. We can do better.”Federal immigration officials said Thursday that California law had prohibited them from arresting a Mexican citizen with a record of deportations and probation violations before he was shot to death Sunday by a Napa sheriff’s deputy during a traffic stop — and that the shooting might never have happened if they had been allowed to detain him. In a graphic 48-second clip released Wednesday,  body-worn camera footage  shows the shooting as it unfolded after Napa County sheriff’s Deputy Riley Jarecki stopped to conduct a vehicle check of a red Honda parked in a southern part of Napa County around 11 p.m. After Jarecki’s brief conversation with Javier Hernandez-Morales, 43, who was seated in the driver’s seat, the video appears to show him rolling down the car window — and then firing at least one shot at Jarecki with what police say was a stolen .22-caliber revolver at point-blank range. The deputy ran around to the other side of the car and fired at least 15 shots into the Honda. Hernandez-Morales, an undocumented immigrant, died at the scene, officials said, and the deputy was not seriously injured. Detectives found a second firearm, a loaded .22-caliber rifle, in the car, according to the Napa County Sheriff’s Office. Officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Thursday that the shooting and his death could have been prevented. State law largely prohibits local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials, keeping undocumented immigrants in custody at the request of federal immigration officials, or asking people who are under arrest about their immigration status. California’s sanctuary law was signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in 2017 and took effect in 2018. Hernandez-Morales, who lived in Napa, had been deported three times before 2011: twice in 2007 and once in 2010. Since 2011, ICE had issued four separate detainers for him related to arrests on suspicion of driving under the influence, battery on a peace officer, selling liquor to a minor and unknown probation violations, ICE officials said in a statement to The Chronicle. None of the detainers — which were issued to the Napa and Sonoma county jails — was honored by jail staff, ICE officials said. Specific details of arrests and violations were not immediately available. “This incident may have been prevented if ICE had been notified about any of the multiple times Hernandez-Morales was released from local custody over the last few years,” immigration officials said in a statement. “This is an impactful, scary example of how public safety is affected by laws or policies limiting local law enforcement agencies’ ability to cooperate with ICE.” A detainer or “immigration hold” is a written request by ICE to a local jail or law enforcement agency to detain an undocumented immigrant arrested on criminal charges for an additional 48 hours after his or her release. The intent is to give ICE time to arrest the individual and begin deportation proceedings. Detainers have been the focus of intense debate for several years, often sparking questions about whether local law enforcement agencies should cooperate with authorities to enforce immigration law. Advocacy groups such as the ACLU argue that the practice allows ICE to detain people without due process, often without any pending charges. Henry Wofford, a sheriff’s spokesman, told The Chronicle that his department was alerted by federal immigration officials to Hernandez-Morales’ status just prior to ICE issuing a press release about the issue on Thursday. “We’re not talking about that information because that’s an ICE issue,” Wofford said. “We know our role has always been sticking with the role of the community.” Immigration officials wrote in their press release they were “grateful” that Deputy Jarecki was not physically harmed during the shooting. “It’s unfortunate that our law enforcement partners and the community are subjected to dangerous consequences because of inflexible state laws that protect criminal aliens,” ICE officials wrote. However, immigration advocates say individual tragic events such as Sunday’s shouldn’t be used to demonize entire groups of people. “We have seen how ICE and the president politicize tragedy, and I think that is irresponsible and wrong,” said Jon Rodney, spokesman for the California Immigration Policy Center. Rodney said the state’s sanctuary law helps crime victims and witnesses come forward without fear of being turned over to ICE. ICE officials said they issued three detainers for Hernandez-Morales to Napa County Jail in 2014, 2015 and 2016. They issued an additional detainer for him to Sonoma County Jail in 2016. Napa County Undersheriff Jon Crawford said in a Wednesday afternoon  news conference  that he believes Hernandez-Morales intended to kill Jarecki when he pulled out the pistol and fired at her. Investigators have not determined a motive in the shooting. The incident is being investigated by the Napa County Major Crimes Task Force, a panel that includes the Sheriff’s Office, the Napa Police Department and the Napa County district attorney’s office. Sonoma County sheriff’s officials could not be immediately reached for comment.A group of supervisors wants to use $13.5 million of the city’s recent windfall money to fund one year of teacher pay raises and will propose the plan at Tuesday’s Board of Supervisors meeting. This is the first proposal on how to divvy up the $185 million windfall that includes the school district, which said  it needs help  sustaining a teacher salary increase it began last year before the funding source was secured. The sudden influx of cash came from excess property tax revenue in a county education fund. The total amount is $415 million, but the City Charter says that more than half the money must go toward budget reserves and certain city agencies. That leaves Mayor  London Breed  and the board with $185 million to spend in the general fund. The  proposal — co-sponsored by Supervisors Sandra Lee Fewer, Aaron Peskin and Rafael Mandelman as of Monday — totals about $196 million, with the additional $11 million plucked from budget reserves. While the school district is already getting $26 million of the total windfall for its rainy-day fund, it needs about $39 million to fund a year of the raises. The supervisors are proposing a $13.5 million forgivable loan, which the district will have to pay back if money from Proposition G — the June parcel tax that voters approved to fund the raise but which is entangled in a lawsuit — is freed up. The proposal also includes $15.6 million to reduce the city’s reliance on Pacific Gas and Electric, and $10 million for early child care and education. The rest of the money in the proposal is allocated toward homelessness and housing initiatives. Meanwhile, Breed wants to use the entire $185 million on homelessness and housing initiatives. Official discussions on how to spend the money are set to begin at the supervisors Budget and Finance Committee next week. Money for power:  Supervisor  Hillary Ronen  wants to create a fund called “the San Francisco Green New Deal” that would collect money intended to reduce San Francisco’s dependence on Pacific Gas and Electric. Ronen’s proposal, which she will introduce at Tuesday’s supervisors meeting, comes as the city explores creating an independent municipal electricity program. The idea  gained significant momentum  this month when PG&E announced plans to file for bankruptcy protection following two seasons of devastating California wildfires it may be held accountable for. But gaining full independence from PG&E could cost the city billions of dollars. San Francisco would have to buy PG&E equipment that includes underground transformers, distribution lines and other infrastructure, some of which may be located outside the city. The fund, which would be administered by the Public Utilities Commission, would collect money for the purpose of purchasing or operating an electric power generation or transmission system within the city. Ronen hopes the first contribution to the fund will be  scraped from  San Francisco’s $185 million windfall. Another source of funding would be from June’s Proposition A, which authorizes the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, with approval from the Board of Supervisors, to sell bonds to pay for clean-energy infrastructure. Will of the voters:  San Francisco City Attorney  Dennis Herrera  is pursuing a court order to validate Proposition C, the November ballot measure that raised taxes on big businesses to fund housing and homelessness programs. Herrera’s office filed paperwork in San Francisco Superior Court Monday asserting that the city correctly applied a simple-majority voting threshold to pass Prop. C, rather than a two-thirds supermajority. The measure drew more than 61 percent of the vote. Herrera is seeking a similar court order to validate Proposition G, a $298 parcel tax that raises $50 million annually to boost teachers’ salaries. “We proactively brought this case to uphold the will of the voters and get the certainty that a court order will provide,” Herrera said in a statement. “We are confident that when voters act through the initiative process, a simple majority vote is required.” If the courts agree with Herrera’s arguments, it would be a huge step toward unlocking the hundreds of millions of dollars Prop. C will raise each year. City officials are waiting to spend that money — plus the revenue from two other ballot initiatives — until the legal uncertainty surrounding the measures’ margin of victory gets resolved. Much of that uncertainty stems  from a lawsuit challenging the city’s use of a simple-majority threshold to pass a June ballot measure that sought to bring in around $146 million annually for child care services and early education by raising taxes on commercial rents. For more than two decades, passing a tax measure for a specific purpose — like homelessness or teacher salaries — required a two-thirds majority to pass at the ballot. But in 2017, a memo from Herrera’s office interpreting a recent state Supreme Court ruling argued that if a proposed tax measure was put on the ballot by citizens — and not the government — it would require only a simple majority to pass.On a recent afternoon in Hayes Valley, Bridger Harlington and Rachael DeVaux ordered food at Souvla before sitting on the Greek restaurant’s new parklet, feet from its front door. Weather permitting, the parklet functions as an extension of Souvla’s dining room, lively in its own way and littered with metal trays of garlic fries and lamb sandwiches. Harlington and DeVaux were visiting from Seattle, and Souvla was their first stop. The pair both agreed that the parklet is a smart business move, adding space for outdoor dining. “I love it,” DeVaux said, right before Harlington added: “It’s something I always look for at a restaurant.” Souvla spent four years and $90,000 to have the parklet constructed only feet from its door in Hayes Valley. Introduced in January, the parklet sprawls across four parking spots on Hayes Street and is capable of casting a shadow across the front doors of Souvla and its neighbor, Patxi’s Chicago Pizza. Since the start of the program in San Francisco in 2010, more than 75 parklets have proliferated across the city, with similar initiatives now headed to Oakland, Berkeley, Miami, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Jose and even San Leandro. Yet questions are growing about the use of public space for the benefit of private businesses such as restaurants and cafes that can afford to build one to essentially expand their seating areas. In the days after it opened, the new Hayes Street parklet garnered a brief protest from a nearby Hayes Street business, True Sake. “A parklet for personal profit literally 30 feet from an actual park — perfect!” read a sign in True Sake’s window, referring to Octavia Boulevard’s social center, the 20-year-old Patricia’s Green public park, which is just steps from the new parklet. Below the board were sake bottles that bore the words “#SoSanFrancisco.” The sign has since been removed, and True Sake’s owners have declined further comment. San Francisco requires parklets to make clear that they are public spaces and part of the city’s program. The design is also supposed to stand alone from the business, at least aesthetically. An example of this can be found at Ritual Coffee Roasters on Valencia Street, where the structure is made to look as though a wooden ship has washed up along the curb. “There is signage on each parklet indicating that it’s part of the city program. By all accounts, it’s rather clear that they are for public use,” said San Francisco Planning Department spokeswoman Gina Simi. “There are no current plans to launch communications efforts to remind the public of that fact.” Berkeley’s new parklet ordinance also requires the spaces have signage saying they are for public use. Still, it’s hard to determine how public it is. At a glance, the Cheese Board Collective’s parklet is a fenced-off space along Shattuck Avenue, often filled with folks who have made a purchase at the pizza spot. It functions as an extension of the dining room. It’s hard to walk through any bustling San Francisco neighborhood without stumbling across a parklet.  While GroundplaySF.org, a multiagency program of the city San Francisco, has tracked more than 75 such spaces, there’s no official count of the parklets that have been funded by and opened next to food or drink businesses. But all it takes is a stroll down Valencia Street in San Francisco’s Mission District to uncover the trend. In the blocks of Valencia Street between 18th and 24th Streets, parklets have opened at the Crepe House, Zaytoon Mediterranean, Ritual Coffee Roasters, the former Blue Fig Cafe (which is becoming a Señor Sisig outpost), Smitten Ice Cream and Dandelion Chocolate. A little farther down Valencia, just beyond 15th Street, is Four Barrel Coffee’s parklet. Hip in its thin, wooden design, the space is most often occupied by folks sipping coffee from Four Barrel. As time passes and parklets become more synonymous with dining, the differentiation between the area being an extension of a restaurant and a true public space has to become more pronounced, experts say. “Parklets have the potential to change the dynamics in a neighborhood,” said Robin Abad Ocubillo, an urban planner with the city’s Planning Department who previously oversaw the parklets program. Yet as as the parklet boom has grown, Abad Ocubillo said city officials were taking notice of who exactly was funding parklets in the city. He admitted that from 2015 to 2018, there was a need for balance as food businesses came to open parklets in waves. He said efforts were made to increase diversity among sponsors. “We wanted to have more non-restaurant and cafe sponsors. It was intentional,” Abad Ocubillo said, adding that the goal required working with nonprofits and youth organizations in the city. Like every other parklet, Souvla’s project went through an extensive vetting process. It began around 2014 and seemingly encountered an endless stream of green lights from the community. Souvla CEO Charles Bililies said his team obtained more than 1,000 signatures of approval on a petition for the parklet project. Public notices were placed in the neighborhood by the city but never seemed to draw much attention. A public hearing was held at City Hall on the matter, and it didn’t seem to slow the progress. “In our case, there was lively public debate, which is very much the purpose of these hearings. Ultimately, city officials ruled for the project to move forward,” Bililies said via email. Despite True Sake’s sign, Planning Department and Public Works officials say they have not received complaints about the Hayes Street parklet. There are standards to be met when it comes to implementation. San Francisco requires all parklets be built at least one parking space away from corners. The speed limit on the parklet street has to be 25 mph or less, and the parklets can’t “interfere with utility access, disabled parking, bus zones, or curbside drainage.” Even the furniture is encouraged by the city to be a mix of permanent and temporary seating that blends well with its surrounding area. The costs to apply for, build and maintain parklets in San Francico can cost anywhere from a few thousand dollars to tens of thousands. It’s a hefty price tag for small food businesses like Venga Empanadas in the Mission, which opened its parklet in 2017. Unlike Souvla, which took four years to open its parklet, Venga Empanadas co-owner Paula Capovilla said it took a little less than two years to create the bright orange seating area. The total cost? About $20,000. “I’d say business has gone up about 20 percent since we got it,” Capovilla said, adding that the investment, which includes annual maintenance costs of around $500, was worth it. “Our customers just love it. It’s a public space, so it’s open to everyone, but it’s hard to imagine not having it.”There are obvious questions when San Franciscans come across a homeless person slumped on the sidewalk, all alone. Where is his family? Where are his friends? Surely, he had somebody who loved him at some point in his life. Where are they? Beverly Stevenson tries to find the answers. She’s an ambassador with Miracle Messages, a nonprofit that asks homeless people if there’s anybody with whom they’d like to reconnect and then uses a volunteer crew of “digital detectives” to track down that long-lost family member. Miracle Messages takes a video of the homeless person speaking to, say, his mother or sister, sends the video via social media, email or text to the chosen recipient, and hopes for the best. Sometimes there’s a good reason for the estrangement, and a video isn’t going to help. But sometimes, a little magic happens. The nonprofit’s work has sparked 194 reunions so far. On a walk along Market Street the other day, Stevenson tried to add one more. “You want to do a video so your mom can see your face? You can send a message straight to her,” Stevenson told 34-year-old Brad Urmston-Parish, who said he’s been living on the streets of San Francisco or in its jail cells for seven years. He’d just been released from a 12-day stint in jail in a burglary case, he said. But that meant he hadn’t used heroin, fentanyl or crystal meth in 12 days, so it was a good morning to record a video for his mom. “I don’t look f—ed up or nothing, do I?” Urmston-Parish asked Stevenson. “I’m actually clean.” “No matter how you look, you look beautiful to your mom,” Stevenson said, bringing her co-worker over to start recording. “Hi mom, I just got out of jail last night,” he said. “I’m actually clean and sober right now. ... Hopefully, maybe you can see it in your heart to let me come back to New Jersey for a little bit, maybe take a flight home or something like that. I just wanted to say hi and I love you and I miss you very much.” Urmston-Parish still had his mom’s cell phone number, which meant delivering the video would be easy. The Miracle Messages team took down his cell phone number and said they’d let him know if they heard from his mom. Stevenson talked to him for a while, encouraging him to use methadone instead of falling back into hard drugs. He  called himself a “drug dumpster”  and said he’s ready to kick the habit after failing many times before. “I’m kind of f—ing sick and tired of being sick and tired, you know? Drugs are just not doing it anymore,” he said. “Whenever I talk to my family members or anybody back home, they’re always like, you’re so bright — what happened? I want to prove to them I didn’t waste my life.” At the end of their talk, Urmston-Parish and Stevenson hugged and told each other, “I love you.” Miracle Messages is the brainchild of Kevin Adler, 33, who founded it four years ago when he was inspired by a homeless uncle who was in and out of his family’s life until his death. Adler and his team wear black T-shirts with white lettering reading, “Everyone is someone’s somebody.” They work all over the country, but in San Francisco it’s mostly in Union Square, where they have  a contract with the area’s business improvement district . Interviewing Adler while walking happens in fits and starts because he stops when he sees any homeless person, greeting him with, “Hey! I’m Kevin.” He wants to know if they have anyone to reconnect with, and he wants them to take a card with the Miracle Messages phone number: 1-800-647-7968. A lot people aren’t interested. Like one man who was stumbling around without shoes, dragging a blanket and eating dry cereal out of a plastic bag. “I think he was more interested in reconnecting to his lighter,” Adler quipped. But Adler can rattle off plenty of success stories and estimates that his team helps 10 percent of the homeless people it approaches. If that’s true, it could make a difference in a city that tallied 7,499 homeless people in its count two years ago. Adler has been pressing City Hall to add a question about family connections to its intake process for homeless people seeking services. “Here’s the question that we’ve found very effective on the streets or when we show up at shelters: Do you have any family or friends you would like to reconnect with even if you don’t know how to reach them right now?” he said. Adler said officials have given him a variety of reasons for saying no. It would take years of study to determine whether the question is valuable. It wouldn’t be fair to other nonprofits that want their questions added. It would look like the city favors family reunification over providing housing and services here. A big sticking point, though, is that Adler wants the city to pay Miracle Messages for work it would do connecting homeless people who answer “yes” to that question with their relative. The city already pays its own employees for similar work on its Homeward Bound program, which provides free bus tickets and sometimes airfare to homeless people as long as there’s a receptive relative waiting at the other end. Jeff Kositsky, director  of the city’s Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, said Homeward Bound helps more than 800 homeless people every year get reconnected. “The program was pioneered here in San Francisco, and we’re glad it has spread throughout the country and to organizations like Miracle Messages,” he said. “I’m deeply impressed and grateful for the hardworking city staff who operate the Homeward Bound program. They perform miracles every single day.” To frustrated San Franciscans, it can seem the city is welcoming all homeless people who enter its 47 square miles  with lots of money and services.  but it’s actually moving toward diverting them out of the city’s system entirely. That’s clearly a good thing. Kositsky explained that in the city’s new coordinated services entry system, the first step upon encountering a new homeless person is to figure out how to get them help without relying on long-term city support. That might be a bus ticket home. Or in the recent case of a man who’d been kicked out by his aunt because she thought there wasn’t space for him, the city paid for a bed and provided extra grocery money. She took him back in. Miracle Messages is a little different in that it goes on the hunt for long-lost relatives. Both the nonprofit and City Hall need to continue their efforts to reconnect San Francisco’s lost souls with their families, getting them off the streets and the city dole as soon as possible. In the case of Urmston-Parish, Miracle Messages delivered his video to his mom and spoke to her the day after meeting him on Market Street. Staff said she was happy to hear from him but dubious about whether he’d really quit drugs. They gave her his cell phone number. His mother left him a voice mail message, but he hasn’t called her back. She had reason to be skeptical. Tenderloin police arrested him Wednesday on a burglary warrant, and he was booked back into County Jail. In unrelated incidents yesterday TL Officers arrested two fugitives;  Luis Guillen, 28 and Brad Urmstonparish, 33.   Guillen wanted for drug dealing and Urmstonparish wanted for burglary. Both subjects booked at CJ and off TL streets.  pic.twitter.com/E1Af3q2Npo“Mr. Stephen! Mr. Stephen! Mr. Stephen!” A 15-year-old boy with severe autism rocked in his chair, calling loudly and repeatedly for his teacher, Stephen Torres Esquer, for help listing his favorite things. He’d scratched out a few answers in lettering that looked like a preschooler’s, but couldn’t think of any more. Torres Esquer crouched down and told the boy, whose birthday was that day, to think of the theme of his classroom birthday party scheduled for later that afternoon. Oh yes, the boy remembered. He loves garbage trucks. He added them to the list. “It’s a garbage-truck-themed party!” said Torres Esquer, the party planner. Torres Esquer is a special education teacher for teenagers with moderate to severe disabilities at Lowell High School, surely one of the toughest jobs in San Francisco. Though City Hall officials have probably never heard of him, teachers like Torres Esquer are at the center of a political squabble over  how to spend the city’s surprise $185 million windfall. Should all of it go to homeless services, as the mayor wants? Or should some go to  teacher raises?  Both are worthy causes, but Torres Esquer’s day-to-day life in hyper-expensive San Francisco demonstrates why teachers should be at the top of the list. The money came from an obscure account called the Education Revenue Augmentation Fund — that first word signals teachers deserve a cut. California law requires that public schools receive baseline funding from the state. In the 1990s, the state ordered counties to share that responsibility and put property taxes in the fund to be directed to schools. “Augmentation” implies extra money, but there was nothing extra about it — the total amount going to schools stayed the same. Any extra money goes back to the county. For the first time, that happened — soaring property tax revenue gave San Francisco a surprise $415 million. There are required set-asides for buses, libraries, tree maintenance and specific education expenses, such as rainy-day reserves, sports, libraries and arts, but nothing tagged for teacher raises. After the set-asides, $185 million is left. Mayor London Breed said in a statement that while she supports better wages for teachers, it’s imperative the city spend that money on homeless and mental health services and affordable housing. “We have been and will continue to engage with the board members about how to allocate this funding so that we have a plan that works for the people of San Francisco,” Breed said. Breed, who opposed November’s Prop. C to raise $300 million annually from the city’s biggest businesses for homeless services, said that despite her concerns over the measure, the voters have spoken. But they spoke in June too, when they approved a parcel tax to boost the notoriously low salaries of San Francisco’s public schoolteachers. The school district has started doling out those raises, but now both measures, and a third to raise money for child care, are held up in court over whether they required a two-thirds voter approval rate and not just a simple majority. So the raises could be rescinded. The superintendent, some supervisors and PTAs  want $60 million of windfall money to cover the raises. Myong Leigh, the district’s deputy superintendent, acknowledged it was a little risky to start paying the raises before the district had its tax money in hand. But considering the  annual crunch to fill all of its classrooms  because teachers leave for better-paying districts or less-expensive cities, there wasn’t much choice. “Everybody had a sense of urgency about improving our compensation for teachers as quickly as we could,” Leigh said. “We have had a very serious  recruitment and retention challenge,  and we knew this would make a big difference.” So some of the windfall money should be used to help backfill raises for hardworking teachers like Torres Esquer. He arrives at Lowell around 7:45 a.m. and stays until anywhere from 5 to 8 p.m. He has a main caseload of 10 students with major intellectual disabilities and works with other special education students throughout the day. Like the 15-year-old boy with Down syndrome who drops in regularly to sidle up to Torres Esquer and talk about the weather. He loves checking the forecast, so Torres Esquer turned him into Lowell’s weatherman, recording weekly segments with him in front of a whiteboard decorated with suns and clouds. Much of Torres Esquer’s work centers on giving these kids real-world, practical help. He has them memorize their parents’ phone numbers, takes them grocery shopping and on Muni rides, cooks meals with them, and takes some to city festivals to speak about what it’s like to live with a disability. “I work all hours of the day and night, but at the end of the day, it’s worth it for me because I love what I do,” he said. He may love his job, but not his mediocre salary. He has a master’s degree in special education, a teaching credential to work with students with moderate to severe disabilities, and a certificate in working with deaf and blind students, all from San Francisco State. He was recently named California Educator of the Year. He also writes children’s books about kids with disabilities. But despite all this, his quality of life hasn’t changed much since he was a student working at Chipotle at Daly City’s Westlake Shopping Center. “I worked there for three years, and my life has not changed very much since then,” he said. “Except I work harder.” Over the past few years,  teacher salaries in San Francisco, which were shameful,  have improved. There’s  a more generous contract in place,  and the parcel tax has put an additional $4,000 to $6,000 in each teacher’s pocket. It’s gotten a little easier to recruit new teachers. But factoring in the city’s insane cost of living, the salaries are nothing to brag about and absolutely cannot go back down. With a bonus for working in a hard-to-fill position, Torres Esquer makes about $68,000. With the new parcel tax money, that has jumped to about $72,000. He could make $11,000 more in Palo Alto Unified and a whopping $30,000 more in the Mountain View-Los Altos High School District. Or he could go somewhere like Stockton, his hometown, make about $13,000 less, but afford far more because that city is so much cheaper. His San Francisco salary is enough to pay $1,500 for a tiny room, without a closet, in a flat shared with three roommates in the Richmond District. He doesn’t have a car. He doesn’t travel. He occasionally eats in restaurants, but never anything fancy. He has monthly student loan payments and sends whatever he can to his three nieces in Stockton whose parents are struggling. “I rarely spend any money because I don’t have any money to spend,” he said. It might be a fine life for a man in his 20s. But he’s 30 now and has no hope of living on his own, much less buying a house. He’s single but could never dream of supporting a family in the city. “The more time I spend in San Francisco, the more I feel like I’m wasting money and also wasting opportunity,” he said, adding he’ll probably move back to Stockton in the next year or two. “There’s not a lot of hope for a future here for someone like me.” He said Stockton isn’t “the most exciting city in the world,” but it offers a better future. “I could buy a house. I could have a savings account. I could start college funds for my nieces,” he said. “There’s a lot I could do there that would not be possible here.” That’s one more San Francisco teacher with an eye on getting out of the city. One who just so happens to be a Spanish-speaking man who adores teaching special education students — a unicorn in the public schools. The city needs to do whatever it can to keep teachers like Torres Esquer. And there just so happens to be $185 million in free money sitting there to help it do that.Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered additional DNA testing Friday in a  1983 quadruple-murder case  involving a Death Row inmate who claims he was framed. In an executive order, Newsom outlined new items to be tested in the case of Kevin Cooper, who was convicted in 1995 of murdering a Chino Hills couple and two children after escaping from a nearby prison. Newsom requested modern-day DNA testing for hairs that were collected from the victims’ hands and crime scene, a blood vial and blood drop, fingernail scrapings from the victims and a green button that came from a prison jacket. In December, nearly two years after Cooper petitioned the state for clemency, then-Gov. Jerry Brown ordered DNA testing of a tan, bloody T-shirt found near the victims’ home, an orange towel, a hatchet handle and a hatchet sheath. Cooper’s lawyers had  asked the governor in February 2016  for a postponement of his execution and a new investigation. Sen. Kamala Harris  offered her support  to Cooper in May 2018, even though she opposed new DNA testing in the case when she was the state’s attorney general from 2011 to 2017. Cooper has maintained his innocence for decades. In 2009, a judge on the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that Cooper “is probably innocent.” Judge William Fletcher, joined by four colleagues, wrote in a 101-page dissent that the judge overseeing the murder trial had dismissed evidence that suggested police framed Cooper, including preservatives in a blood sample that indicated officers had taken blood from a lab and sprinkled it on a shirt to frame him. “I take no position regarding Mr. Cooper’s guilt or innocence at this time,” Newsom wrote in Friday’s order. “Especially in cases where the government seeks to impose the ultimate punishment of death, I need to be satisfied that all relevant evidence is fairly examined.”In a stark video showing what appeared to be an assault, a man was shoved and punched in the face at UC Berkeley this week while advertising for a conservative cause at a table on the main campus plaza, police said Wednesday. The battery was reported at 3:29 p.m. on Tuesday to campus police, who found the victim suffering from facial injuries. Two men had approached the victim, identified Thursday as Hayden Williams, who had been advertising at a table in the plaza for the conservative group Turning Point USA, and began arguing with him, according to police. The victim started filming the encounter. One of the men knocked the phone out of his hand, knocked down the table, and then hit the victim several times, authorities said. Another conservative student was assaulted on  @UCBerkeley \\'s campus. I just spoke to the survivor of the attack who is a dear friend of mine. He is in good spirits and plans on continuing to fight for conservative values on campus once his black eye is gone! What a bad a**!  pic.twitter.com/g67Y9pAszD In an email sent to the campus community, Chancellor Carol Christ said it appeared that the victim was a Berkeley student, and she condemned the attack. “Let there be no mistake: We strongly condemn violence and harassment of any sort, for any reason,” Christ said. Later in the day, the victim’s employer, the Leadership Institute, said he was not a student, and university officials said they were now not sure whether he was or not. “I know it was a student group, but I have no idea whether he was a student or visitor,” said university spokesman Dan Mogulof. Their enrollment statuses would not affect the investigation, authorities said. “It’s stifling and chilling free speech, and students are afraid to express themselves,” said Bryan Bernys, a vice president of campus programs at the Leadership Institute, which trains conservative advocates. Williams declined to comment. The university settled a lawsuit from  conservative groups  alleging discrimination against campus speakers in December, paying $70,000 to the Berkeley College Republicans and Young America’s Foundation for attorney fees.Shiny Oxford shoes, furry paws and dusty hiking boots all stamped down a freshly packed dirt path Friday in Golden Gate Park, where the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department reopened a main trail bearing a longtime city servant’s name. Formerly known as the Oak Woodlands Trail, the newly renamed Phil Arnold Trail is a 0.7-mile sliver of the regional  Bay Area Ridge Trail  that winds through the northeast corner of Golden Gate Park, connecting two parts of the larger route between Stanyan Street and Arguello Boulevard. A crowd of outdoor enthusiasts and city officials packed the entrance to the trail Friday morning on John F. Kennedy Way, before unveiling new trail markers honoring its namesake. Arnold has spent 33 years working for the city, including a decade with the city’s Recreation and Park Department, before joining the Human Services Agency. Most recently, he has served as a chairman for the San Francisco Housing Authority’s Finance and Resident Engagement Committee. He also sits on the San Francisco Parks Alliance board of directors. When park commissioners met last October, general manager Phil Ginsburg said that Arnold deserved the honor for his lifelong dedication to the city’s open spaces. “When I think about public service and what it means, and how to be a servant leader and how to give back to one’s community, I often think of you,” Ginsburg told Arnold. Wearing a navy blue beanie and hooded jacket Friday, Arnold accepted a plaque bearing the trail’s name. “It knits together so much of my professional life,” he said, gesturing at the winding route, flush with sturdy oak trees, California lilacs and black-capped chickadees. The Recreation and Park Department closed the dirt walkway in June 2018 for renovation. In recent months, workers cleared away dead brush and brought back native plants to the space. On Friday, dozens hiked the Golden Gate Park trail snippet while guides pointed out plants and birds perched atop tree branches. Denise Louie, a Golden Gate Park Nursery volunteer, and Christopher Campbell, a Recreation and Parks natural resources specialist, stopped and peered into a nook of a cypress tree where a colony of honey bees buzzed. Many critters, such as woodpeckers and squirrels, live in the oak woodlands. They rely on the other species in their ecosystem to provide food and shelter, said the two temporary tour guides. “It’s like the  Rainbow Grocery  of Golden Gate Park,” Campbell said with a laugh. Bits and pieces of the Bay Area Ridge Trail have been added in recent years, lining the tops of the region’s highest peaks and ridges. The 375-mile trail now stretches from Gilroy to Calistoga. When complete, it will form a loop around the Bay Area.Elisa Barragan heard the screams first. Neighbors rushed into the yard of the San Jose house that she had rented for 20 years, yelling “fire.” One of them grabbed a hose from next door and sprayed the roof as an electrical fire began to spread and melt the gutters. Barragan ran. Not out, but farther inside, to the rear bedroom to her 24-year-old son, Isaiah Alcala. Born with half a brain, Isaiah has paralysis of all four limbs and cannot swallow or speak. “I was not going to leave him,” Barragan said. She stayed with Isaiah until four men, all of them strangers, plowed through the smoke to the back of the house and carried Isaiah outside. In minutes, the San Jose Fire Department arrived, then a television crew  to cover the heroic rescue  for the evening news. It was Mother’s Day, this year. The family was safe, but the troubles had just begun. Suddenly homeless, Barragan, 61, had to temporarily leave her son at a residential facility. Her 9-year-old granddaughter, Khloe, who has lived with Barragan for most of her life, went to stay with relatives. Barragan checked into a Motel 6 and began to search for a new apartment in San Jose — the city where she grew up and raised a family but could no longer easily afford. In August, the family found a place to rent in a neighborhood near downtown San Jose called Little Portugal. There was a catch: Barragan had to post a security deposit, and had only a few weeks to come up with the money. It was a tough task for someone on a fixed income. Facing possible homelessness again, Barragan turned to Midtown Family Services, where office coordinator Lidia Jimenez helped her gain one-time assistance through The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing Fund. The grant from Season of Sharing covered the deposit. When Isaiah was born, he was the first disabled person that Barragan had ever met. She quit her job as a secretary at a banking company to take care of him and hasn’t worked a steady gig since. The family subsists on her Social Security income and her late ex-husband’s pension. Isaiah was diagnosed with a range of disabilities, including microcephaly, a condition in which a baby’s head is abnormally small, usually the result of the brain not developing properly, either in the womb or after birth. Isaiah has never spoken, Barragan said. But he coos for her when she sings to him. Barragan sometimes puts a tambourine where Isaiah’s arm crunches against his chest, letting him pretend to play along with his niece Khloe on guitar. She’s heard her son’s laugh once. “We try to live a normal life, but the reality is it’s not normal,” she said. After the fire, when Isaiah was placed into the residential facility, Barragan said some people tried to persuade her to keep him there. They wanted her to be able to join her extended family on trips to Disneyland and to enjoy retirement without limitations, she said. Separating her blended family permanently was never an option, she said. The day she went to pick up Isaiah from the facility and bring him to their new home in Little Portugal, Barragan said she felt butterflies in her stomach. “I felt like I was in love for the first time,” Barragan said.

The incident was reported just after 11 a.m. at 1800 H St., according to the city’s Police Department. By 3 p.m., a juvenile suspect was in custody and students were no longer on lockdown. Neither the male suspect nor the male victims were identified, but police said the people stabbed were at school at the time of the attack. The suspect was found by authorities around 1:30 p.m. in Hayward, said Capt. Travis Souza, a spokesman for Union City police. One of the victims was transported to the hospital with stab wounds. The second victim had minor stabbing injuries, but did not require hospital care, Souza said. No information on a possible motive was immediately available.The barista in chief of the United States came to San Francisco on Tuesday to say that President Trump “needs to be fired,” and that he just might be the fellow to replace him. Howard Schultz, the former head of the 28,000-store Starbucks coffee empire, also said if the Democrats pick some “far left-leaning challenger” — someone besides him, for instance — then the “chances of Trump getting re-elected are high.” Throughout his hour-long speech to the Commonwealth Club of California, Schultz didn’t say he was running for president as an “independent centrist,” and he didn’t say he wasn’t. But he said the country ought to be run the way he ran his coffeehouses — where all baristas got stock options, health care and the possibility of a college scholarship. The billionaire son of a diaper delivery truck driver from Brooklyn, Schultz lamented that it was “tragic” that the U.S. government is making a profit from student college loans that charge 8 percent interest and called for a “basic level of fairness’’ from national leaders. The corporate income tax reduction signed into law in 2017 was a “terrible mistake” too, Schultz said, because it “rewards shareholders” instead of average workers. Instead, Schultz said, Congress ought to do what he used to do at Starbucks board meetings — put an empty chair at the table, to represent the customer. In Schultz’s version of Washington, he said, the same empty chair would be installed in all government meetings to represent the average citizen. There weren’t any empty chairs in the Herbst Theater, however, where more than 500 folks paid $40 to hear the coffee man. Each ticket came with a free copy of Schultz’s new 352-page book — there was no way to attend the speech and not get one. The book had 50 pictures of Schultz in it, along with a sticker on the title page signed by Schultz, a highly caffeinated way of autographing a book for a new age. Besides not signing actual books, it appears that Schultz was also too busy to vote in actual elections. According  to the Seattle Times , Schultz cast ballots in only 11 of 38 elections dating to 2005. He voted in all the presidential races but was a no-show for high-profile midterms in 2006 and 2014. Robert Anderson, like just about everyone else in the hall, had the book in his lap but didn’t read it. He also said he prefers Philz and Peet’s coffee to Starbucks. Mitch Forster of Piedmont was holding in his lap two copies of the book — one that had been given to him and one to his wife, Carolyn. He said that was either one or two copies more than the couple needed. “I haven’t decided yet,” Forster said. Ellen Sears of San Francisco said it takes more than the ability to sell 30 cents worth of coffee and milk for $4.50 to be president, although it’s a start. “Being president takes experience and understanding,” she said. Margaret Duggan of Alameda, who was knitting a sweater in the theater lobby, said there were “so many candidates, it’s all pretty confusing and people just don’t have the bandwidth to sort through it all.” “But we do need a (new) president,” she added, “because the one we’ve gotten is broken and it’s time to send him back, and I don’t care if we get a refund or not.”Mayor  London Breed  wants to get a new $300 million affordable housing bond in front of San Francisco voters. And she wants it on the ballot by no later than March 2020. Breed announced Monday that the bond would be added to the city’s 10-year  capital plan,  a blueprint for infrastructure spending over the next decade. The plan, which is updated each odd-numbered year, lays out proposed timetables for when general obligation bonds will go before voters. In addition to adding an affordable housing bond to the schedule, Breed has also requested that city officials move up the date of a proposed $600 million bond that would pay for seismic retrofitting and other earthquake-resiliency work on public safety infrastructure, like police and fire stations and the 911 operations center. “We need to build more housing in San Francisco, especially badly needed affordable housing to help keep our communities stable. This requires us to invest in solutions to build homes for people who need them,” Breed said in a statement. “We also know that our public safety infrastructure must be able to withstand any upcoming earthquakes. These are both key priorities for our city, and we will work in the coming weeks to bring people together and determine what elections make the most sense for these bonds to be successful.” The capital plan currently has the earthquake bond scheduled for this November’s election, when Breed will be running for a full term in the mayor’s office. The affordable housing bond is slated for the March 2020 primary. That schedule could change as city officials debate the timing of which bonds get issued when and digests public input, meaning the housing bond could appear on this November’s ballot. Approval from voters means the city is authorized to issue new bonds as previous ones get paid off. Should voters green-light the affordable housing bond, the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development would use the money to acquire, preserve and construct affordable units. Chaired by City Administrator  Naomi Kelly , the Capital Planning Committee charts the city’s course for issuing bonds, staggering them over time to ensure that the city can fund needed projects, but without taking on so much debt that property taxes need to be raised. The committee has to sign off on a bond proposal before sending it to the Board of Supervisors. With the board’s approval, the bond measure then has to pass the ballot with a two-thirds majority. The reshuffling of the bond schedule would push back a $255 million bond for parks and open space until November 2020. — Dominic Fracassa Full circle:  George K.H. Schell , a former Coca-Cola executive and a previous general counsel for the Oakland Athletics, is joining the San Francisco city attorney’s office next week. City Attorney  Dennis Herrera  announced  Monday that Schell had been hired to lead the office’s Contracts and Special Projects Team. In that role, he’ll provide advice to city departments to ensure compliance with contract requirements in the government’s interactions with the private sector. He’ll also weigh in on complex contracts involving intellectual property and property and special projects around major entertainment and sporting events. The hiring is something of a homecoming for Schell, who worked as  chief of litigation in the city attorney’s office from 1988 to 1993. “It is with great pleasure that I welcome George back to the City Attorney’s Office,” Herrera said in a statement. “George will help us continue building the requisite business knowledge and contractual flexibility to help San Francisco meet the many legal challenges generated by emerging business innovations and operations.” Schell worked for Coca-Cola for 20 years, most recently as the company’s chief marketing counsel. “I hope to play a key role in the office’s focused effort to help San Francisco maintain and grow its position as a world leader in effective municipal interaction with the business community,” Schell said in the statement. — Dominic FracassaAn excruciating pain jolted Zander Brandt awake at 1 a.m. on Nov. 1. He tossed and turned, unable to sleep, and when his wife touched the painful spot on his midsection, he vomited. “She was like, ‘OK, that’s not a good sign,’” he recalled. “Let’s go to the emergency room.” The couple rent an apartment on the edge of the Mission, just blocks from San Francisco General Hospital. Brandt, a 31-year-old project manager at a financial technology company, had heard horror stories of short ambulance rides costing patients thousands of dollars. So instead the couple walked, slowly and gingerly, to the city’s lone trauma center. But what they thought was a frugal course of action turned out to be just the opposite. Brandt left the hospital two days later with the pain — and his appendix — gone. But despite having health insurance through his employer, he now personally owes the hospital $92,470. Now excruciating. Though it’s too late to help Brandt, Mayor London Breed, the Department of Public Health and the hospital have just agreed to  halt the practice of “balance billing”  — sending patients bills if their private insurance companies don’t pay the full requested amount — immediately but temporarily. Last year, that practice stuck 300 patients — Brandt included — with unexpectedly big bills. The 90-day respite from balance billing is intended to give the hospital time to come up with a long-term plan to treat privately insured patients more fairly. “Although balance billing affects a very small number of (S.F. General) patients, the stress and hardship they experience when it happens is very real,” Breed said in a statement. “In an emergency, people’s focus should be on getting help quickly, not on what hospital they should go to.” As it comes up with a plan, the hospital has begun pursuing contracts with private insurance companies, though CEO Susan Ehrlich wouldn’t say which ones or how many. She said S.F. General will also do a better job informing patients they may qualify for financial assistance, look at expanding the income requirements to qualify for charity care, set an out-of-pocket maximum for patients, and study how other Bay Area hospitals handle their billing. That’s all great news, but there’s one big caveat. The halt isn’t retroactive — and Brandt still owes $92,470. And hundreds of other patients stressed out over their shockingly high bills are still on the hook, too, stuck in endless Dilbert-like phone exchanges with hospital billing agents and sent after 90 days to collections at the city treasurer’s office. “The retroactive part of it is what we need to study,” Ehrlich said in her hospital office. “Anybody who was subject to these policies previously, that’s something we have to work with our city partners and city policy makers on. All that was done under policies that were in place at the time.” But if it’s agreed now that those policies are broken, they were broken last year, too. All privately insured patients who have outstanding bills at S.F. General should have them forgiven. Ehrlich said it’s too soon to say whether that will happen, because hospital officials have a duty not only to provide excellent medical care, but to be good financial stewards. She said the hospital’s roughly $1 billion annual budget comes half from Medi-Cal, a quarter from Medicare and the rest from the city, private insurance companies, patient bills and other sources. She said she doesn’t yet know how much forgiving those outstanding bills would cost or where the money would come from. “We view ourself as a very special resource for the city and all of the people who live here,” Ehrlich said. “We want to make sure we do a better job in the future of taking care of people’s financial health as well as their physical health.” A Board of Supervisors committee hearing on the billing situation has been set for Feb. 21. Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who called for the hearing, said patients like Brandt should “absolutely” see their bills cleared and that the hearing will include a discussion of whether to make the new prohibition on balance billing retroactive. “These people should be made whole,” he said. At issue is the fact that S.F. General has no contracts with private insurance companies, which was  first reported by Vox . That means the hospital charges all privately insured patients the full rack rates approved each year by the mayor and Board of Supervisors. In its forms, the hospital states that it bills patients’ private insurance companies “as a courtesy.” But because there are no contracts with those companies, they can pretty much decide to pay whatever they want. The problem is the hospital sticks the patient with the rest, which can amount to tens of thousands of dollars for everyday ailments like appendicitis, broken bones and migraines. California law inexplicably bans balance billing for patients insured through health maintenance organizations, but not for those insured through other forms of insurance, including preferred provider organizations. It’s privately insured patients who aren’t on HMO plans who are facing the big bills from S.F. General. Brandt is insured through Aetna on a exclusive provider organization plan, which offers a local network of doctors and hospitals but pays nothing toward out-of-network care. True emergencies must be covered by exclusive provider plans if treated out of network, but there’s a dispute over Brandt’s bill because he was moved to in-patient care and waited more than 36 hours for surgery, as new patients with gunshot wounds and other traumas kept taking priority. “They told me about an hour before I was going into surgery that S.F. General is out of network for every provider and because I have an EPO, I wouldn’t be covered for anything,” he said. “I was like, ‘Are you kidding me?’ I said, ‘OK then, I’m going home.’ They said, ‘Well, we wouldn’t recommend that. We just want to let you know that we charge an average of $20,000 to $30,000 a night.’” He said hospital officials called around, but no other emergency room in the city had space for him. So he proceeded with the appendectomy at S.F. General on the afternoon of Nov. 2 and was discharged Nov. 3. Several weeks later, he received a bill for $97,000. Aetna has paid a few thousand, but Brandt still owes $92,470. “It was a shock,” Brandt said of the bill. “We’ve been trying to save up to buy a house here in the Bay Area, which obviously is extraordinarily difficult, and this would all but end that.” He saved two voice mails from the hospital shortly after being discharged, one reminding him of his follow-up appointment and one recommending he not show up for it because it would cost him so much more money. Told there’s now a temporary halt on balance billing — but that he’s still on the hook for $92,470 — Brandt said that’s “pretty outrageous.” “It’s pretty unfair they’re able to take in the money from me, but not someone who’s getting an appendectomy tomorrow,” he said. “It seems like a no-brainer that this should be applied unilaterally to anyone with pending bills.” It’s a no-brainer indeed — and here’s hoping City Hall and the hospital will see it that way. Eventually.The one-story house that sits on Mandarin Avenue has been in Lisa Johnson’s family for more than half a century. Johnson’s parents bought the house after moving from Montgomery, Ala., to Hayward in 1961. It’s the house she and her siblings grew up in, and it has been a constant throughout her life. “I’ve lived in this house since I was 4 years old,” Johnson said. “I’m 62. My parents left me this house.” The house has been there as Johnson pursued a career in dentistry and received master’s degrees in business administration, accounting and education. When her mother died in 2010, the house became hers. A relatively low mortgage payment, and rent money from tenants Johnson took on, made the home affordable to live in. But then a series of misfortunes struck. In 2013, health issues forced Johnson into retirement. She currently depends on an electric wheelchair to get around her house. A year ago, Johnson and her tenants were forced to move for several months after her refrigerator broke and flooded the house, which was then red-tagged for asbestos. And in May, a loan modification and supplemental tax assessment nearly tripled her monthly mortgage payment. In between, a food-borne illness landed Johnson in the hospital. On top of all that, several deaths in the family had taken an emotional toll. Her church helped Johnson with house repairs and assisted in finding new tenants, but the relocation after the flood and loss of rental income made it difficult for her to keep up on her mortgage payments. She was on the brink of losing the house when one of her tenants told her about The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing, which offers one-time grants to people in unexpected crises. With the hope that the fund might save the place she’s called home for nearly her entire life, she applied and was awarded with enough to cover a monthly mortgage payment. “It has made it possible for me to keep my house,” Johnson said. “It gave me some breathing room and it gave me some credibility because I think (her lender) thought, ‘She might not make it this time.’” Johnson’s story stood out to Alameda County caseworker Andrea Wong, who handled her case, because of how accomplished Johnson was and how her health and other issues took over. “It’s just a reminder ... just how vulnerable our lives can be,” Wong said. “Illness, grief, stress — those things can really destabilize us.” Now, Johnson is redecorating her home with photos of her loved ones. She’s working at a tutoring center and has a night job at a warehouse to make ends meet. Her house, she said, will not be in the family after she’s no longer there. She said she has endowed it to her church and an educational institution. It’s her way of giving back to the people who helped her. “If you help someone a little bit, they might be able to give (back) to you,” she said. For 32 years, The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing Fund has helped more than 150,000 Bay Area individuals and families facing unexpected life crises. Want to help?

Democratic lawmakers across the country have made affordability at public colleges and universities a rallying cry, with free tuition programs popping up at the state and local levels. During the 2018 midterms, the free-college mantra of Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders became a key campaign promise for liberal candidates in congressional and state races. Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom pledged during his own campaign to make the first two years of community college free in California, as did some of his Democratic challengers. “This is about strengthening the middle class,” said Assemblyman Miguel Santiago, D-Los Angeles, who partnered with Assemblymen David Chiu, D-San Francisco, and Kevin McCarty, D-Sacramento, to pass a bill last year making the first year of community college free for full-time freshmen. Democrats were solidly behind  AB19  — all the “no” votes came from Republicans, who will be even more badly outnumbered next year and unable to block anything, including the Democratic legislators’ new measure. Their  AB2,  introduced this month, would waive tuition for the second year as long as a student takes a full course load each semester and remains continuously enrolled. Santiago said that requirement will get students to an associate’s degree or certificate program quicker and improve the pipeline between community colleges and the state’s public university systems. The two-year savings for a student taking 12 units a semester would be $2,208. That could mean the difference between having to take out more loans or pick up extra hours at a job. But it also costs taxpayers millions a year:  Click here  to read about that and the rest of the story. Deep dives and late takes • Drink till 4 a.m.:  State Sen.

Maybe buying up some of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.’s power lines? City Hall reporters Trisha Thadani and Dominic Fracassa go through the politics of it all on  a City Insider podcast. The Trump turnout Like him or not, President Trump gets people to the polls — even when he’s not on the ballot. The  turnout of eligible adults in last month’s California elections  matched the highest in nearly five decades for a non-presidential year, the secretary of state’s office says. It’s not that the state races this time were all that exciting — far from it. Elections for  governor  and  U.S. senator  were lopsided affairs, and only one initiative, to  repeal a gas-tax increase,  got much traction. But the chance for voters to send a message about Trump, even through  proxy elections such as those for the House,  proved to be almost as strong an attraction for voters as the 2016 presidential election was. That election brought more voters to the California polls than any since 1984, save one — the 2008 vote in the midst of an economic crisis that resulted in Barack Obama’s election. After parsing all the numbers, the state reported that 50.45 percent of eligible adults voted last month in California. That tied 1982 for the highest turnout of eligible adults in a midterm year since 1970, when Ronald Reagan was running for a second term as governor. Like what you’re reading?

At the end of a midday rally on the second day of the Oakland teachers’ strike, a few hundred people gathered in West Oakland’s DeFremery Park and marched to the offices of GO Public Schools, an Oakland-based nonprofit that supports charter schools. The teachers, students and parents wrote messages on fake dollar bills and taped them to GO’s doors, in an act they said symbolizes money being drained from public school coffers to support charter schools. “This is around the whole issue of the concern that GO Public Schools is promoting the privatization of the public schools agenda, and is supporting school board members who are also doing that,” said Mike Myslinski, a spokesman for the California Teachers Association. Teachers in the district have widely criticized charter schools, which are alternative public schools, saying there are too many in the city, contributing to a loss of students and the state money that comes with them. Charter schools operate independently, but with district oversight. Nearly 14,000 of Oakland’s public school students attend one of the 34 charter schools in the district. Jonathan Klein, a co-founder of GO Public Schools, said that about 20 strike supporters targeted him at his home before dawn Friday morning. A spokesman for the teachers’ union denied that any of its members went to Klein’s home. The executive director of the GO Public Schools, Jessica Stewart, released a statement denouncing the notion that charters hurt public schools. “Anyone who suggests we would act to hurt Oakland’s public schools, or carry someone else’s water in this community, does not know us and is deliberately seeking to mislead,” Stewart wrote. “We stand with Oakland’s teachers and families in the fight for better pay and better student supports, and condemn in the strongest terms these dishonest attempts to make headlines by sowing division.” Charter schools have been a target of criticism in many of the teacher strikes across the country in the past year. This week, teachers in West Virginia walked out to protest a bill that would have allowed charter schools in the state for the first time, and in Los Angeles last month, the school board agreed to vote on a resolution for a temporary moratorium on new charter schools in the district in response to the strike there.These are sad days along San Francisco’s hip Valencia Street corridor. The Lucca Ravioli Co., one of those old-line businesses that had a uniquely San Francisco style, is closing. Lucca has been on the corner of 22nd and Valencia streets for 94 years. By Easter Sunday, it will be gone. Lucca is one of those places everybody ever associated with the city remembers. It looks like a cave packed to the ceiling with Italian goods — two dozen styles of salami, cheese, pasta, pesto, marinara, manicotti. The clerks at the deli counter all wear paper hats and will make a sandwich to order, then ring up the sale on a big, old-fashioned, brass cash register. The outside of the building is painted red, white and green, the Italian colors, and the windows are plastered with handmade signs advertising panettone, imported rice, Italian plum tomatoes, fresh pizza dough and other goods for sale. On the Valencia Street side, you can look in the window and see the staff making ravioli on some kind of mysterious machines. Not just any ravioli — Lucca has a reputation for the freshest and the best. It’s the Tiffany of ravioli. “Shopping at Lucca is like going back into a slice of another time,” said Bryan Smith, a clerk at Dog Eared Books at 20th and Valencia. He likes the service, the neighborhood feel and the style of the place. “Closing Lucca is a disaster for me,” he said. Lucca has lots of fans like Smith. The place is crowded all the time, even on rainy days. “We’re busy as hell,” a clerk said on the day the building was put up for sale. The end of Lucca is not just the end of a local institution. It’s part of another San Francisco story. The fact is Lucca Ravioli probably can’t survive in today’s San Francisco. The property is just too valuable. In fact, the company sold its parking lot just up Valencia Street, which can hold about a dozen cars, for $3 million. For that price, you could buy a villa in Italy. The new owners plan a five-story residential development. Not long after the parking lot sale, Michael Feno, the CEO of the family-owned store, decided it was time to retire after more than 50 years. He could not find a way to keep the business in the family, so he put the store and two adjacent buildings, part residence and part pasta factory facilities, on the market. The price: $8.285 million. It’s one of those only-in-modern-San Francisco stories. You own a classic business and a couple of properties at 22nd and Valencia, and now they are worth a fortune. Now it’s time to cash out. Feno began working at Lucca, sweeping the floor, when he was 11 years old and has not stopped since. And he doesn’t want to talk about the sale. “Look,” he said, “I’m busy. I’m working every day from 5 in the morning to 7 at night. I got no time to talk.” NAI Northern California is handling the sale. The commercial brokerage calls it a “monumental opportunity to reposition the current warehouse/manufacturing space ... to a high-performing retail, service, and/or residential use.” The parcel “is located in the heart of the Mission District directly on the upscale Valencia corridor,” which it describes as “an unmatched cultural environment not replicated anywhere else in San Francisco.” Across the street from Lucca is a Social Security office and the popular Boogaloos restaurant. A prime location, NAI says. It says that last year, the area within a 1-square-mile radius of 22nd and Mission streets generated “$4.648 billion in total consumer expenditures.” The company notes that ground floor retail/commercial lease rates “in this highly popular retail destination” are among the highest in the city. When the sale closes the Lucca property, it “will be delivered vacant.” The last day for Lucca is April 20, the day before Easter. “It’s a sign of the times,” said Don Giordano, a regular customer. “I understand the need for more housing,” said Alex Jones, who lives in the neighborhood and was shopping at Lucca the other morning, “but everything is going to be more high-rises.” He remembers a similar Italian deli in Oakland that closed down as well. “I think places like this are all going away,” he said. When Lucca is gone, a bit of old San Francisco will be gone forever. They say San Francisco is losing its soul. I don’t think so. It’s just for sale.Citlali Gonzalez-Watson and Justin Watson were living in a two-bedroom mobile home in Sunnyvale with six other people when their son Daniel was born over the summer. Citlali and Justin slept in one bedroom with their baby, Citlali’s parents had the other bedroom, and her four younger siblings slept in the living room. The crowded environment quickly took its toll. “There was so many of us, and then they had different schedules and stuff, so it was just overwhelming,” Citlali recalled. “We were like, ‘No. We need our own place again.’” Citlali, 19, and Justin, 20, used to live in military housing in Alameda while Justin was serving in the Coast Guard. But he obtained a voluntary discharge because he was facing deployment and did not want to leave his wife, who was pregnant at the time and has a heart condition that required frequent doctor appointments until the baby was born. At first, the couple lived with Justin’s parents in Ventura County. But Justin’s parents are both in the military, making them less available to help with child care than Citlali’s parents, he said. So after a few months, the couple returned to the Bay Area. It quickly became apparent they needed more living space than the mobile home allowed. But Citlali and Justin both work service-sector jobs, and getting a foothold in the tough local housing market was all but impossible without help. So they turned to the nonprofit Sunnyvale Community Services, which tapped into the The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing, which agreed to provide Citlali and Justin with the first month’s rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Milpitas. To keep costs down, one of Citlali’s co-workers moved in with them. “We were getting back on our feet because we just left from her parents’” home, Justin said. “We just needed help for the first month, and then once her co-worker moved in, we knew that we could handle it.” And each of them is still hard at work as they settle into their new living situation. Sitting on the couch together with Daniel on a recent weekday morning, Citlali and Justin said it was a rare instance when neither of them had to be on the clock that day. The two of them work long hours, she on the closing shifts managing a McDonald’s in Mountain View and he at a Wayback Burgers that’s walking distance from their apartment. Citlali’s family cares for the baby when neither of them is home. They rarely have a full day of free time to spend together. For 32 years, The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing Fund has helped more than 150,000 Bay Area individuals and families facing unexpected life crises. Want to help?

But they’ve made some life adjustments to try to get the most out of the precious few hours they do spend together in their home. “At night, we have a no-phone rule,” Citlali said. “After we get home, it’s just like: Relax. Phone’s in the corner.” The couple’s ability to communicate well with one another stood out to Maria Buenrostro, their caseworker at Sunnyvale Community Services. Buenrostro described them as a “wonderful, working together” kind of couple. “One of the most important things that I saw was how closely they communicated, not just as a married couple but as parents,” Buenrostro said. “It makes sense how they were able to live in spite of the crowdedness in the mobile home.” Still, all the work can be overwhelming to Citlali at times, complicating her efforts to balance her job against routine matters such as staying on top of the laundry or simply spending time with her child. But juggling is nothing new to her. She was enrolled in two classes at Foothill College while pregnant with Daniel, to whom she gave birth the week before a take-home final exam was due. Citlali did not seek an extension, instead choosing to complete the assignment on a laptop alongside her infant’s bassinet. She recalled thinking silently to Daniel, “Don’t cry, don’t cry,” while scrambling to complete the exam — which she did. Citlali has put her education on hold for now, as Daniel and her job demand her full attention. She may end up taking classes online depending on plans she and Justin have been discussing for themselves. With Citlali’s health now in the clear, the two have started considering whether Justin should try to re-enter the military. Justin said stability is the biggest factor driving his thinking about the military, given the housing and health benefits he and his young family would receive. He’s thinking of joining the Navy like his father, who would be able to offer guidance. But trying to re-enlist would once again raise the prospect of deployment. “One minute you’re in California, and then another minute you’ll be in Japan or somewhere crazy,” Justin said. Citlali is willing to move overseas with Justin if duty calls — even though it would mean leaving her parents and siblings behind for an extended period of time. “Like my mother-in-law once said, ‘You have to put your big girl panties on,’” she said.Three days before Willie McCoy, a  young black man, was fatally shot on Feb. 9 by six officers from the Vallejo Police Department , a bill that would update a law that astoundingly hasn’t been changed in almost 150 years was introduced in the Assembly. California’s law governing when a homicide by an officer is justified was written in 1872 — nine years after the Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves. If there’s anything that is overdue to be rewritten, this is it. The bill, AB392, would regulate when police can open fire on people. “That bill would establish very clear standards and guidelines for when officers can and cannot use deadly force,” Lizzie Buchen, a legislative advocate for the ACLU of Nortnern California, told me. “If that bill passes, then all agencies would have to update their use-of-force standards.” According to the bill, deadly force would be acceptable only to prevent imminent death or serious bodily injury. It would require law enforcement officers to exhaust every alternative before firing their service weapons. It would allow police departments to discipline or fire officers who use unnecessary deadly force. The bill will make it easier to prosecute police officers for their actions. Yes, sometimes officers have to use force. They do a dangerous job in which people at times try to kill them — like what apparently happened over the weekend in Napa, where a deputy’s body camera showed a man firing at her before she shot him dead. But cops are trained professionals. We have a right to expect them to be better, and with this many people of color dying in these particular ways, we as a society have to help cops — make them — become better. “When you change policy, you will hopefully change people’s attitudes,” said Assemblywoman Shirley Weber, D-San Diego, one of the bill’s co-authors. “You will change how they’re trained to do their jobs.” This isn’t the first time Weber has tried to change the state’s use-of-force policy. As my colleague Alexei Koseff reported, the  measure is nearly identical to a proposal  that was shelved at the end of the last legislative session. That measure was introduced amid public outrage over the death of Stephon Clark, a black man who was unarmed when police fatally shot him in Sacramento in March. The law needs an update, because there isn’t enough accountability for police officers who fatally shoot people like McCoy. Police killed more than 100 civilians in California in 2018. Only a  few cases were prosecuted . For two years, I’ve written about the police shooting black and brown people in Vallejo — people who might still be alive if officers were governed by higher use-of-force standards. McCoy was asleep in his car in a Taco Bell drive-through lane, and then was shot dead. According to police, when McCoy awoke he reached for the fully loaded, semiautomatic handgun with an extended magazine, that was in his lap. Yes, McCoy had a gun. That’s not in dispute. He should’ve been arrested for carrying an illegal firearm. The Vallejo Police Department, which hasn’t returned my requests for comment, hasn’t addressed why officers felt an imminent threat to their lives. McCoy was hit more than 20 times. The bullets pelted his face, shoulders, chest and arms, according to a family attorney who viewed his body. An official coroner’s report hasn’t been released. The bill doesn’t take away an officer’s right to use deadly force. It just defines when deadly force can be used. Again, this is as important as the new California law  requiring cities to unseal police misconduct records . “All of it is important if you’re going to do reform, but clearly changing the use of lethal force will have an impact because, obviously, we hope there will be fewer incidents of people being shot,” Weber said. The bill was referred to the Assembly Public Safety Committee on Feb. 15. “This bill will hopefully make the use of lethal force the last thing you do and that the purpose of doing it is because you know that this person is going to do you bodily harm,” Weber said. Law enforcement organizations lobbied against last year’s bill, arguing that a change would make it more dangerous for police patrolling the streets because it would make officers hesitant. Earlier this month, a similar bill backed by law enforcement was introduced in the state Senate. It stops short of holding officers accountable for their actions, just like the people they arrest. That’s not good enough. Just like the people they arrest, the police aren’t above the law. “The majority of time, officers conduct themselves and do not cross that line,” said Assemblyman Kevin McCarty, D-Sacramento, a co-author of AB392. “When there is an officer that crosses the line, we think this bill will force departments to rethink their practices and focus on less lethal tactics and de-escalation.”San Francisco received more money than any other California county except Los Angeles in this year’s round of federal homeless funding grants, and much of that will go toward dozens of programs to house people permanently. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded San Francisco more than $44.5 million this year, up from $41.5 million last year. That is also more than double the amount the city received in 2011, reflecting a steady rise in annual grants since then. In all, the nine-county Bay Area scored $153 million in homelessness grants, which are announced in January and are the single biggest disbursement of funding for homelessness from the federal government. Alameda County and its major cities got $37.6 million, the second most in the region. The bulk of San Francisco’s package was $38 million for 47 permanent supportive housing projects. An additional $1.7 million went toward improving a coordinated entry system that more efficiently routes homeless people through city services so that care and housing can be cost-effectively tailored to them. “We are focused on moving people off the streets and into housing and shelter,” Mayor London Breed said. “This funding is critical to helping us continue the work we have been doing to keep people housed, expand our system, reforming how we get people into services and fund new supportive housing for chronically homeless people.” The annual round of federal grants makes up a small part of the more than $300 million San Francisco spends each year for counseling and housing homeless people, but city planners consider it key to the package. Los Angeles County received $124 million in grants, the most in the state. That is more than last year, when it got $109.4 million. — Kevin Fagan Last October’s horrific wildfires in Sonoma and Napa counties made one thing abundantly clear: The worst of times brings out the best in people. Within hours, locals had mobilized to feed and house their traumatized neighbors, launching a tidal wave of grassroots philanthropy. From the No Pay Café, born on the second night of the fire, to free yoga classes, efforts continue to help fire victims get back on their feet. A year later, new homes are rising and communities are healing, but the recovery for many is far from complete. “We’re still providing free meals every Saturday,” says Sheana Davis, a Sonoma caterer who dreamed up the No Pay Café after evacuating her own home on Sunday evening, the first night of the fire. One year in, the communities stricken by the October wildfires are on the rebound although at different paces. Some replacement homes are rising; other plans are hamstrung by insurance shortfalls or labor shortages. Emotions are still raw, with residents on edge until this year’s fire season passes. The huge outpouring of support — financial and otherwise — took many residents by surprise and reminded them that people internationally feel a connection to these famous wine regions. Hashtags like #sonomastrong and #napastrong quickly alerted the world that these communities were resilient and would bounce back. Despite the optimism and outpouring of support, many folks are still struggling. In both Napa and Sonoma counties, a shortage of construction labor is hindering many residents’ plans to rebuild and is sending costs soaring. Terence Mulligan, president of Napa Valley Community Foundation, estimates that building expenses have doubled since the fire, reaching $500 to $800 per square foot and leaving many victims facing a giant chasm between their insurance payout and their needs. Homeowners who are rebuilding worry that too many neighbors won’t, especially in Sonoma County, where many of those affected were of modest means. “A lot of people find it too daunting,” says Jacqueline Scott, who, with her husband, Brian, is rebuilding the family home in Santa Rosa’s Larkfield Estates. “There’s such a backlog.” The Scotts’ general contractor told them that he has 90 contracts that will take seven years to complete. Researchers say one of the stages victims experience when recovering from trauma is disillusionment, a confrontation with reality and a sense of uncertainty that emerges after the immediate crisis fades. “I think it would be accurate to say we’re in that period right now,” says Caitlin Childs, director of communication for the Community Foundation Sonoma County. “Homeowners are still questioning what they’re going to do next.” David Leal, who lost his home in Santa Rosa’s Coffey Park, is hoping the free yoga classes he teaches will help others to decompress. “I was seeking anything I could do to relieve my own stress,” says Leal, who has now been trained, along with 56 other local instructors, in trauma-informed yoga. “People have told me, ‘This is my one hour of peace a week,’” says Debbie Mason of the Healthcare Foundation Northern Sonoma County, which underwrites the teacher training and classes. Compared with Sonoma, Napa Valley’s recovery seems further along, probably because more affluent residents took most of the hit. “Few visitor-facing businesses were affected physically,” Mulligan says. “You almost need a Sherpa to take you around to see the significant personal losses.” Tourism in Napa plunged in October but quickly recovered, says Clay Gregory, president of Visit Napa Valley. Hotel bookings were barely off for the association’s fiscal year, which ended in June. “Given how dramatically things went awry in October, we’re happy where we landed,” Gregory says. “We’re blessed that people love coming here.” Even as wildfires have ravaged swaths of the state farther north of Wine Country, the late-summer weather has been eerily perfect in these two picturesque wine valleys, and the leafy vineyards show no wounds from last year’s drama. “There are visible scars if you look for them,” Santa Rosa Mayor Chris Coursey says. “But for the most part, all the things that make this a great place to visit — our wineries, our coast, the river and the redwoods — were not affected.” For their part, Leal and his neighbors have their own plan for the fire’s one-year anniversary. “We’re going to meet at 2 a.m., when things went down in Coffey Park,” he says. “We’re going to celebrate resilience and recovery.”The wind pounded against the window panes and whistled under the front door. It screeched, hungry and alive. In her 61 years, Astrid Granger had never heard anything like it. She was elbow-deep in dirty dishes, scrubbing away encrusted pasta sauce, as the gale increased. Her grown children had driven to Santa Rosa, one from Sebastopol and the other from Oakland, for family dinner. Now, just before midnight on Oct. 8, she stood alone in the kitchen, listening to her Coffey Park home shudder in the wind. The wind carried the acrid scent of smoke. There was a fire burning somewhere, she thought. Not here — maybe in a far-off place like Lake County, which was 65 miles to the north and always seemed to be aflame. Her cream-colored home on Jenna Place with the petunias out front was safe. Still, the wind scared her in a way she didn’t yet understand. Its howling made the hair rise on her arms. She called her brother in Germany. “Something terrible is happening,” Astrid told him. “It’s so windy it’s like there’s a tornado outside. I don’t think we will survive this night.” A few blocks away, in a pretty tan house on Astaire Court, the lights sputtered for a second or two before the electricity cut out for good. Melissa Geissinger, 34, lit a row of candles. She hadn’t been able to fall asleep. The wind was blowing too hard. It was just before 2 a.m., and the sky was a blizzard of ash and debris. Trash pickup was in a few hours, but the blue and green plastic bins were being blown all over the street, spilling recyclables and spoiled food. The clatter had awakened their neighbor, and he was standing in his underwear in the driveway, gaping at the hot storm. Melissa Geissinger and husband Cole at the site of their home in Santa Rosa that was destroyed by the Tubbs Fire. Melissa watched from the living room window while her husband, Cole, 31, searched for news on his phone. She was seven months pregnant with their first child, and Squiggy — the baby’s in utero nickname — somersaulted in her belly, a reassuring distraction from the adrenaline rush. Two of their friends, who lived 8 miles away on Shiloh Ridge, had already fled their home as flames approached and planned to sleep on an air mattress on the Geissingers’ floor. That was starting to look iffy. Melissa began packing a few things — a framed photo from a recent trip to Denver, her work computer, a signed Kenny Loggins poster from childhood — just in case they needed to leave, too. There weren’t many reports online, but from what Cole could tell, a fire had sparked earlier that night in Calistoga, 16 miles to the northeast. They were safe, he thought. But 10 minutes later, an alert pinged on his phone. The flames had jumped Highway 101, just east of their neighborhood. The wind was carrying the wildfire to Coffey Park. That Sunday began normally — it was warm, quiet, even still. If it had ended that way, so much would have been different. But that wasn’t Coffey Park’s fate. Astrid and her husband, Henry Granger, 78, had lived in the neighborhood for 30 years, ever since Henry retired from the military and moved here to work as a private pilot. The North Bay was pricey even then, so he left Astrid and their two young children behind in Goshen, a tiny town near Visalia in Tulare County, until he could buy a home. He found the perfect one in Santa Rosa, in a new neighborhood being developed off Highway 101. The year before, construction crews had finished Mocha Lane, and he took out a mortgage to buy a home on the next street to be developed, Jenna Place. In July 1987, the Granger family was the first to move in on the street. He and Astrid might have gotten strange looks elsewhere — she’s white, he’s black, they were raising mixed-race children — but in Coffey Park, they felt safe and accepted. In Alabama, where Henry was born and raised, people stared. It happened in Astrid’s native Germany, too. Not here. The neighborhood welcomed everyone. Astrid Granger shows a photo of the home that she and her husband, Henry, lived in for 30 years in Santa Rosa’s Coffey Park neighborhood. Melissa and Cole Geissinger moved in just nine houses away in July 2015, imagining the family they would soon begin. By then, Coffey Park had settled into suburban middle age. There were mature apple and apricot trees in the backyard. Melissa looked at a built-in bench off the deck and saw herself spending weekend afternoons there, reading. It was nearly beyond their budget. They took out a mortgage and bought the house anyway. The place felt like a mansion. It was double the size of their first home in Cloverdale, which was 900 square feet. They were so excited that they didn’t wait for the furniture to come — they ate and slept on the carpeted floor. One of the first things they hung on the wall was a custom branding iron, wrought into the loops of their joined initials. At their wedding, they branded three wood planks — for each set of parents and themselves — as a symbol of unity. The iron was among their favorite possessions. They created a business, designing websites within 24 hours for clients. They hosted friends to play nerdy board games like Settlers of Catan and Dead of Winter and watch nerdy movies like “Battlestar Galactica.” They celebrated two pregnancies and mourned the loss of one of them. They were a team. On what would be their last afternoon on Astaire Court, they shampooed the carpet and painted the nursery gray. The day was blissfully ordinary. For the Geissingers and the Grangers, there hasn’t been one of those since. Around 9:45 p.m. on Oct. 8, a fire ignited near Tubbs Lane in Napa County for reasons that remain unknown. The blaze would feast on the county’s brittle woodlands as Diablo winds blowing at speeds up to 80 mph picked up the sparks. Fire rained down for miles. The Tubbs Fire reached the edge of Santa Rosa at the worst possible moment: in the early hours of Oct. 9 when nearly everyone was asleep. But at 2 a.m., Astrid wasn’t among them. She couldn’t doze off. Even with the windows closed, smoke was filling the house. In the distance, electrical transformers were exploding, a cacophonous POP-POP-POP. Henry went outside to retrieve the couple’s trash bins, and Astrid turned on the radio. Somehow, they still had electricity. What she heard made no sense. The fire she thought might be in Lake County was within a mile of her home. The Kmart on Cleveland Avenue was burning down, the newscaster said. The Kmart? How could that be? She used to buy Henry’s clothes there. The air was thick as milk. Astrid wheezed asthmatically. By now neighbors were zipping by in their cars, abandoning their homes. “You need to evacuate to a safer area,” pinged a message on her phone from a parishioner at her church. That’s when Astrid knew it was real. In the distance, there was orange light in all the places orange wasn’t supposed to be. She changed out of her pajamas and stuffed a towel under the closet door. She didn’t want her clothes to smell like smoke when she returned. “Let’s go park our car in the park,” Henry said. They lived less than a block from Coffey Park, where 20 years ago, before it had opened, their kids  climbed under the fence to play. “We can wait out the fire there.” “No, we can’t do that,” Astrid said. “What if the park burns, too?” The main thoroughfare, Dogwood Drive, had become a tangle of traffic. The streetlights were out, and everyone was honking. Some people abandoned their vehicles and ran, their backpacks bouncing with every stride. Astrid grabbed their expired passports by mistake instead of the new ones. She took two purses and her citizenship and birth certificates, forgetting Henry’s insulin and other medications. There was no time to think. Henry got in his car, and Astrid got in hers. Their daughter, Audrey, who was spending the night, loaded her duffel into a third car. One by one, they merged into the exodus from Coffey Park. Astrid feared that everything was already lost. But she locked the front door anyway. Melissa white-knuckled the steering wheel. It was 2:16 a.m., and she couldn’t breathe. The car windows had been open all night, and ash filled the vehicle. Apples and bananas rolled around in the backseat. Melissa wasn’t sure why she ran out the door with them instead of the new camping gear or more clothes than what she’d scooped from the dryer. In those too-few moments, all she could register was that she and Cole would eventually need to eat. As she drove away, the wind blew tree branches, trash bins and God knows what else onto the street. Nothing looked familiar, and she missed a turn she had taken hundreds of times. Cole followed in his car, their cat, Ascii, loose in the backseat. Their friends who had hoped to sleep on the air mattress left as well. “Don’t do anything stupid,” Melissa told herself. “Think of the baby. Don’t cause an accident.” They were driving to her parents’ home in Sebastopol, and she had never been so scared. They wouldn’t be coming back to the same place, she knew. It was all going to be gone. But she couldn’t process that, not yet. “Missy, nothing is going to happen to your house,” her mom, Nancy Crain, said over the cell phone. “Stay on the line. Just stay on the line.” Melissa was sobbing. “Stay calm,” Crain said, trying to talk her daughter out of hell. “Keep your eye on the road. Watch out for other people.” “I will, Mom,” Melissa said. “Mom, if you saw what I’m seeing. I’m sure the house is gone. The wind and the smoke ...” “Just breathe,” Crain said. “Take your time.” “But Mom ...” “Breathe.” The murky-red sunlight of dawn revealed just how thoroughly the lives of the Grangers, Geissingers and 7,000 other residents of Coffey Park had been altered. In all, the Tubbs Fire destroyed 4,651 homes and killed 24 people, including four in Coffey Park. It displaced tens of thousands before it was vanquished 23 days later. But on Oct. 9, there was no talk of victory. The fire raged in Sonoma County’s hilltops and gullies, and ash fell like weirdly warm snow in cities as far as 50 miles away. Henry, Astrid and Audrey had driven 3 miles to the Finley Community Center, a shelter for evacuees. It was full, so they drove 8 more miles to Charles M. Schulz Sonoma County Airport. Henry had flown out of there many times. It had a big parking lot and bathrooms. They spent what was left of the night there in separate cars, together but isolated, unable to ask for comfort, unsure if there was something of comfort to ask for. They didn’t know if their home had burned, but could see flames on the horizon, stretching from Windsor to Santa Rosa. A sobering, horrible, lonely night, Astrid thought. Where do you go when your home is gone? When it was light, the Grangers piled into one car and drove to Coffey Park — around barriers and on back roads, getting as close as they could until the police forced them to park. Then they walked. The neighborhood was still smoldering. Every house, for as far as they could see, was gone. There was nothing left, not even chimneys. “So much is just missing,” Astrid told Henry. “So much is gone.” A car sits flipped over on Dogwood Drive in the Coffey Park neighborhood of Santa Rosa after the Tubbs Fire. The street, the main thoroughfare out of Coffey Park, was jammed with fleeing residents the night of the fire.  In the center of the neighborhood park was the husk of a burned-out car. The grass was scorched black. That could have been us, she thought. The trash bins had liquefied, now just blue and green stains on the street. Rivers of aluminum from melted cars were frozen on driveways. The sidewalk crunched like glass underfoot. Astrid saw two of her neighbors crying, looking at what was once their house. She gave them a hug, knowing she would probably never see them again. And her house — it was gone, too. The $18,440 air conditioner and heater they had installed the week before, the kind of expense that seems worthwhile after 30 years in one place. The painted tiles from Europe and the family jewelry smuggled from East Germany during the Cold War. Only a few crispy garden statues and cracked ceramics were left. “After so many years, you get to update your house a little bit, and all the things you always thought, ‘One of these days,’” Astrid said as she looked at the rubble. “You finally get the house to look the way you want it to, and then in one night, it’s gone.” The hummingbirds that built their nests in her ash trees were dead. She was sure of it. Astrid used to feed them sugar water. The nests were gone, along with the branches. The white picket fence in the front yard — vanished. Even the bark on their redwood tree in the backyard looked odd, spiraled and burnt off, like it wasn’t a tree anymore, but something alien. Nothing distinguished their lot from all the others. Astrid plucked a singed piece of sheet rock from the rubble and wrote their last name with it on the driveway. She drew a long arrow pointing to where their home had stood. She couldn’t believe it. She didn’t want to come back here ever again. “This  was home?” she thought. “This  was  home.” A pause, and finally: “This was  home .” Henry Granger pauses while searching through the remains of his family\\'s Coffey Park home after the Tubbs Fire. One year ago, more than a dozen fires shot to life in the North Bay. One of them, the Tubbs Fire, would become the most destructive wildfire in California history, killing 24 people and incinerating entire neighborhoods in and around Santa Rosa. One of those was Coffey Park. Henry and Astrid Granger, who had lived there for 30 years, and Melissa and Cole Geissinger, residents for just two years, survived the fire but lost all they had. In the year since the fire, The Chronicle’s Lizzie Johnson has spent hundreds of hours with the two couples to report this story, witnessing some of the most intimate, heartbreaking and joyous moments as they rebuilt their lives. Lizzie Johnson is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

First, it was at 1 a.m. on Nov. 1 with excruciating pain in his midsection.  As I told you recently, he wound up receiving an appendectomy  at San Francisco General Hospital and wound up with $92,470 in charges. A week after the column ran, he was roused from sleep for a much more pleasant reason. A representative from his insurance company, Aetna, phoned from Florida at 6:30 a.m., apparently forgetting about the time difference. The time was a little annoying, but the news was great. Brandt would instead owe just his $250 co-pay. Was it because of the column? “Oh, 10,000 percent,” said Brandt, a 31-year-old project manager at a financial technology company. He said Aetna had previously told him any decision on lowering his bill would take six to eight months. “Insurance companies and hospitals aren’t really going to be proactive about this so they’re forced to be reactive when bad press comes out,” he said. S.F. General wouldn’t comment on Brandt’s case, but a spokeswoman with Aetna said in a statement: “Although San Francisco General is not currently a participating provider in Aetna’s networks, we reached out to the hospital and negotiated a rate for this claim. Mr. Brandt will not be financially responsible for any amount other than his co-pay. We appreciate the hospital’s cooperation and assistance.” Brandt and his wife celebrated that night with empanadas and mojitos. “I was 100 percent thrilled,” he said. It was one happy ending in the many stories stemming from  an unfair billing system at S.F. General  that has left thousands of unwitting patients like Brandt with huge bills. At issue is the hospital’s policy of not entering into contracts with private insurance companies and instead charging the full rack rates approved each year by the mayor and Board of Supervisors. Because there are no contracts, the insurance companies can pretty much pay whatever they want, and the hospital sticks patients like Brandt with the rest. That has repeatedly added up to eye-popping bills of tens of thousands of dollars for more common ailments such as appendicitis, migraines and broken bones. While the Department of Public Health, which runs the hospital, previously estimated the number of patients affected last year at 300, it now says that number is likely to be as high as 1,700. Mayor London Breed and the hospital agreed this month to halt what is called balance billing for 90 days while the hospital comes up with a fairer system. That is likely to include entering into contracts with some private insurance companies, setting an out-of-pocket maximum for patients, and expanding who may qualify for charity care. But the question of whether patients hit with big bills before the 90-day pause are still on the hook remains as clouded as a San Francisco day in July. This month, hospital CEO Susan Ehrlich said, “The retroactive part of it is what we need to study.” Rachael Kagan, spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Public Health, said Wednesday: “We are pausing all outstanding patient bills. ... When a new patient billing policy is determined, that will be applied.” A pause is good. A cancellation would be even better. Supervisor Aaron Peskin has called a hearing for Thursday on the hospital’s billing practices. In preparation, he met Wednesday morning with Ehrlich, public health chief Greg Wagner and other health officials. According to Peskin, they don’t want to issue a blanket statement zeroing out all previous bills because they still want to wring as much money out of patients’ private insurance companies as possible. But they also know they can’t leave people like Brandt on the hook for the difference if that number is sky high. “They said, ‘Look, if people call us, they’ll get counseling and we’ll work it out with them,’” Peskin said. Another tidbit he gleaned is that the hospital drops bills if they’re unpaid for four years, though the patients’ credit ratings can be damaged. Peskin said the number of people with outstanding bills received within the past four years is “several thousand.” Peskin said he told the health officials he wants them to stand up in the hearing and announce they will send letters to every patient with an outstanding bill explaining it will be taken care of by the hospital. We’ll see Thursday whether they take him up on that challenge. In the meantime, I decided to try to help a couple more patients. One was Tyler Pousson, 33, who lives on Nob Hill and works in tech. He was riding his motorcycle on Lombard Street in February 2018 when a car pulled in front of him, and he swerved and fell. “My knees were a little sore. I scraped my arm and hand. My helmet got a little banged up,” he recalled. “But there was nothing serious at all.” A witness called 911, and an ambulance arrived. “Next thing I knew, they were telling me to lie down, not move, that whole jazz, you know?” he said, adding he had no say in where the ambulance took him, and paramedics insisted on driving across the city to S.F. General, the city’s sole trauma center. Hospital staff did tests and kept him overnight for observation, but nothing was wrong other than “a few bumps and bruises,” Pousson said. The bill for determining nothing was wrong? A whopping $58,482.20. His insurance company, United Healthcare, paid $34,222.68. He showed me a bill from the hospital for $24,259.52 with the words in red type, “PAST DUE.” He couldn’t pay it, and the bill was sent to collections. “I don’t get how I have insurance, and I’m stuck with a bill for $24,000,” Pousson said this month. “It makes me lose faith in the medical system and the local government, especially. It’s really stressing me out. It’s one of those things that keeps you up at night, and you wonder how you’re going to get out of this.” The best way to get out of it, it seems, is media coverage. On Tuesday, I asked the hospital about Pousson’s case. A spokesman said he couldn’t comment because of privacy laws. On Wednesday morning, Pousson received a call from the treasurer’s office, which serves as the city’s collections agency, telling him his account is on hold and the hospital is reviewing his case. “This may be a good sign,” he told me. Do the right thing, S.F. General! The hospital did do the right thing for Griffin Knight — eventually. Knight (no relation) had a similar story as Brandt, waking up with severe pain in May, heading to S.F. General and receiving what may be the world’s most expensive appendectomy. Well, the second most expensive, after Brandt’s. The hospital billed his insurance company, Aetna, $82,000. Aetna paid about $10,000, and Knight owed the rest. He showed me a copy of a bill from S.F. General for $70,248.50 and letters reading, “PAST DUE.” Knight, a 24-year-old consultant who lives on Russian Hill, said Monday he’d spent 80 hours trying to sort out the mess and had made no progress. He was considering hiring a lawyer or even filing for bankruptcy. “I’m 24, and this was my first real encounter with the medical system, and it’s been kind of a nightmare,” he said. I asked S.F. General about his case Tuesday, and again the hospital spokesman cited privacy laws. On Wednesday, Knight received a call from the hospital’s accounting department. “They said that they will be wiping the entire charge, and I will only owe a $200 co-pay,” he said. “I am ecstatic!” It was the right decision by the hospital, and one that needs to be repeated many more times.There’s often a feeling among regular San Franciscans that their leaders at City Hall just don’t get it, that they can’t empathize with regular residents’ everyday frustrations. But when it comes to the recent revelation that  San Francisco General Hospital doesn’t contract with private health insurance companies  and regularly sticks privately insured patients with huge bills, the second in line to the mayor’s seat  understands patients’ anger  all too well. That’s because he was one of them. For Norman Yee, president of the Board of Supervisors,  Dec. 26, 2006, was supposed to be a fun night of salsa dancing at the now-shuttered Glas Kat. He’d parked his car and was walking in a crosswalk at Fourth and Bryant streets on a green light to reach the club. As is often the case with life-changing moments, the memories years later are choppy. He remembers hearing “a big old bang” and then remembers not being able to move. The big old bang was the sound of a car barreling into him. His body flew up onto the hood, struck the windshield and then rolled back down onto the pavement. He couldn’t get up. “I heard an ambulance coming,” recalled Yee, who was a school board member at the time. “I remember them cutting off my clothes to see what happened.” What happened was bad. A severed artery. A cracked skull. Nerve damage. Crushed vertebrae. “There are two rods holding my neck up,” he said in an interview in his City Hall office the other day. “That’s my neck — two rods.” He explained that the injury is the reason he often appears stiff. The rods allow him to bend his neck so he can look down, but not bend it back so he can look up. He still has nerve damage and often mixes up the feelings of hot and cold. He’s left handed, and injuries to his left arm mean he can only write a couple of sentences before feeling fatigued. The ambulance took him to S.F. General, where he was in and out of consciousness for a while, and doctors thought he might be paralyzed. It took days for the feeling to return to one finger, and more time for him to wiggle his other fingers and toes. Yee, known for being placid and unemotional, said with a laugh that the first thing he said to his wife when he came to was that she needed to move his car, which was still parked near the club. He didn’t want to get a hit with a big towing bill. But a towing bill would have been the least of his worries. He showed me a light blue folder filled with old paperwork, mostly from S.F. General but also from Kaiser, which insured him back then and still does. He’d stayed about two weeks at the city’s lone trauma center and another two weeks at Kaiser’s hospital on Geary Boulevard. He faced another five grueling months of recovery at home, during which he had to buy a walker, a wheelchair and stair railings. The trauma, he said, was compounded when the bills started arriving — more each week, it seemed. “This is $4,000, this is $8,000, this is $3,000, this is $1,000,” Yee said, shuffling through the old paperwork. “They freaked me out when I got them — what is going on here? “I said, ‘Oh my God, I’ve almost been killed, and now I’ve got a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of bills. Who’s paying for this?’” he continued. “I knew I needed professional help.” Yee hired Dale Minami, one of the city’s best known personal injury attorneys. (He also co-founded the Asian Law Caucus and helped overturn the 40-year-old conviction of Fred Korematsu for refusing an order during World War II to report to a Japanese internment camp.) The details of Yee’s case are fuzzy 12 years later, and Minami said he purged the files years ago. But he said he “negotiated a very, very steep reduction for Supervisor Yee.” Kaiser ended up paying most of the bill, Minami said. Yee also recovered a little money from the car’s driver, who was underinsured, and a larger amount from his own auto insurance policy, Minami recalled. He said the whole thing took about 18 months to resolve. Minami and his law partner, Mark Fong, have handled hundreds of cases of patients treated at S.F. General who later received bills they couldn’t afford. The hospital, which doesn’t contract with any private insurance company, has long charged the full rack rate and billed patients for whatever the insurance companies won’t pay. “Part of the irony is San Francisco General has a great trauma center,” Minami said. “In a way, you want to go there. But if they’re going to charge you the full freight, then you have to make that difficult decision about your physical health versus your financial health. That’s cruel to make people do that.” Fong said the full rack rates the hospital charges privately insured patients are inflated. The rates are approved annually by the Board of Supervisors — yes, including Yee — and the mayor. “You can’t blame them for wanting to recoup as much money as possible, but the way they’ve gone about it is so heavy-handed as to be ridiculous,” Fong said. Since the hospital’s billing practice came to light, the  hospital and mayor have agreed to halt what’s called balance billing  for 90 days while they come up with a long-term plan. They’ve also paused outstanding bills from patients treated before the 90-day halt began. It’s unclear what will happen to those bills after the 90 days are up. Hospital brass have said they intend to educate patients better about their billing practices, set an out-of-pocket maximum for patients, expand who can qualify for charity care and start contracting with some private insurance companies. Though Yee can empathize with other patients facing financial frustrations, he doesn’t seem motivated to become a champion of the cause. The collision did prompt him to become a pedestrian safety advocate, but he said it never occurred to him other trauma victims might be facing similarly big bills. “My whole energy was on trying to get well,” he said. “I wanted to forget about it as much as possible.” Does he want to take the lead on fixing the billing problem now? Not really. “Some of my colleagues are looking into it,” he said. That’s mainly Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who called  a hearing on the matter  set for 10 a.m. Thursday in Room 263 at City Hall. So does Yee have any advice for S.F. General patients going through this billing hell now? He sure does. “Get a lawyer.”The California Republican Party has never been less relevant. It has no statewide elected officials. It’s a super-minority in the Legislature. Only 1 in 4 registered voters belongs to it. And the state’s entire GOP House delegation can fit in a minivan. Yet the three people vying to be state party chair  this weekend at the GOP’s convention  in Sacramento aren’t calling for wholesale changes. Far from it. They don’t think the party needs a new approach to  immigration  or climate change, issues where polls say the GOP is out of step with California voters. Nor should it back away from President Trump — even though  62 percent of likely California voters polled in January said they disapproved of his job performance. “It’s a great day in America: Donald Trump is president,” would-be party chair Steve Frank said on my  “It’s All Political” podcast , repeating the line he uses during his frequent appearances on conservative talk radio shows across the state. Neither of his opponents would disagree. Absent any policy differences, the main  distinction between the candidates is a battle over whether the problem is, in fact, what’s left of the California Republican Party’s establishment. The 1,400 delegates meeting this weekend will choose between Frank, whose roots in the California Republican Party go back to Ronald Reagan’s first term ... as  ; Travis Allen, who ran for governor last year and thought the Republican opponent backed by Trump, John Cox, was too liberal; and Jessica Millan Patterson, a longtime party operative unknown to the public but the favorite of the GOP’s withered establishment. On Thursday, Frank and Allen announced that they were joining forces to lead “the resistance” at the convention  against Patterson and the party establishment. In the likely event that delegates deadlock Sunday in their first vote  for a new party chair — a candidate needs a majority of delegates to win — Frank and Allen have urged their backers to support the other one for party chair on a second ballot against Patterson, who would be the first female chair in California Republican Party history. For those trying to keep this straight, that’s two conservative Republicans calling themselves the leader of “the resistance” — against their fellow Republicans. Here’s where the candidates stand on the GOP’s biggest problems, and what to do about them: Reaching nonwhite voters:  Nonwhite Republicans are becoming more rare by the day. Latinos, the state’s single largest ethnic demographic, long ago fled the party.  Eighty-six percent surveyed  by the group Latino Decisions said after the November midterm elections that they had voted for a Democratic House candidate. Seventy-three percent said Trump had done or said something that made them mad. Frank, 72 ,  who attended his first state GOP convention in 1966, conceded that “we’ve never opened a conversation with Latino voters.” Yet none of the candidates embraces a pathway to citizenship for undocumented residents. There’s no need, Frank said: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott won 41 percent of the Latino vote in his recent re-election bid “with the exact same values and positions on immigration as the California Republican Party.” The solution, Frank said, is simple: “Show up at the Hispanic communities. ... Go to the Hispanic Grocers Association. We don’t do the real work that the Texas Republican Party does.” Allen agreed that Latinos and Republicans are philosophically aligned. His solution is not to try to cater to “identity politics,” as Democrats do, but to win over Latinos and everyone else with Republican values of small government and conservative social positions. Patterson, who is Latina, said she could open new doors for the state party because “I would be the first person to look like me who would be chairman.” She said she would expand the party’s work with organizations such as  Grow Elect, which has helped 230 Latino Republicans  win election to local nonpartisan offices. However, the party’s brand is so toxic that only one Latino Republican sponsored by the group has been elected to partisan office, where candidates have to reveal which party they belong to. Winning moderate voters:  Frank, publisher of the conservative newsletter California Political Review, doesn’t think the party should change to appeal to more moderate voters on issues such as a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and climate change. The  GOP’s platform,  he said, “is based on actual economics and real science — not junk science.” The party’s real problem in November was that “we didn’t have a statewide message for the voters,” Frank said. “If you don’t have registration, if you don’t have candidates, if you don’t have a message, the debacle of November 2018 was easily predictable.” Allen, who believes  “the verdict is still out”  on climate change, agreed that the party should be more conservative instead of “Democrat lite.” But Patterson said the party needs to talk about issues in a different way while not alienating potential supporters. “We all care about the environment,” Patterson said. But “it’s not just what you say, but how you say it to people as well.” Growing the GOP brand:  Allen promised to get 100,000 California Republicans to give $10 a month and direct the money into voter registration efforts. Allen said only he could do that because he counts 25,000 people on his list of supporters and donors. Reality check: In 2018, the state GOP had roughly 37,000 donors who gave $100 or less, according to party officials. Frank, a longtime social conservative, thinks the party can grow by reaching out to evangelical Christians, most of whom he said are not registered voters. Allen blasted Patterson for receiving the endorsement of nearly every elected Republican in the state Legislature (many of whom served with Allen in Sacramento), along with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield. Allen said those endorsements and her leadership of California Trailblazers, an organization that trains GOP candidates, are an “example of the failing status quo.” Former East Bay Assemblywoman Catharine Baker, a moderate who lost her re-election bid in November,  told The Chronicle last month  that she worried centrist GOP lawmakers would leave the party if Allen became chair. Patterson declined to respond to Allen’s comments because “I don’t talk poorly about my opponents, or any other Republicans for that matter.” “But,” Patterson said, “I would say that I’d rather have someone like Catharine Baker in office who is voting with Republicans 89 percent of the time than the Democrat that’s there now who will not.” While the candidates bicker, outgoing party chair Jim Brulte, a longtime state senator, offered simple advice for how Republicans can change the party’s fortunes: Talk to someone other than white Republicans. “Unless and until Republicans in California get a lot more Hispanic, Asian American and African American votes, we are going to struggle at the ballot box,” Brulte said. “Republicans spend way too much time talking to the choir and not enough time talking to people who can be converted.”That didn’t take long. Supervisor  Katy Tang  still has a few days left at City Hall — her term ends Tuesday at noon — but she already has a foot in the private sector. Tang will join the land use and real estate department at Farella Braun + Martel, a law firm that has long been involved with shepherding housing and commercial development projects through San Francisco’s convoluted planning approval process. Tang, who has represented the Sunset and Parkside neighborhoods for the past six years, said she became interested in land use matters even before the late Mayor  Ed Lee  appointed her to the Board of Supervisors, during her stints as an aide to former Supervisor  Carmen Chu  and a policy and finance staffer under former Mayor  Gavin Newsom . As a supervisor, Tang was instrumental in creating the city’s housing density bonus programs and streamlining the permit process for accessory dwelling units, among other things. “I really wanted to stay involved in policy matters as they relate to land use and development,” Tang said Thursday. “Whether you build something or don’t build something has a significant impact on the community. It’s a fascinating topic.” Under San Francisco ethics regulations, Tang, who graduated from the University of San Francisco School of Law, can’t appear before San Francisco boards or commissions for a year after leaving office. She can offer advice to other attorneys at Farella about San Francisco matters, but can’t interact with city officials. Steven Vettel , who heads up Farella’s land use practice, said Tang would bring “political sensibilities and policy chops” to the firm and be an “incredible resource to our clients.” “Katy has been a true steward of the city, helping steer it through an incredibly transformative time, especially with respect to land use and development,” Vettel said. Last year, Tang said she would not run for re-election. Her seat will be filled by  Gordon Mar , who beat Tang aide Jessica Ho in November for the District Four seat. — J.K. DineenThe  psychiatric emergency room  at San Francisco General Hospital is licensed for 18 beds, but on Monday morning there were 26 patients crammed in just about every corner of the small, drab facility. Three men sat in the tiny waiting area in their stocking feet. All patients must remove their shoes because laces can be used as nooses and shoes can be hurled as weapons, a nurse explained. A man in bare feet and hospital scrubs spoke in animated gibberish and twirled like a ballerina in the reception area. Another man, clutching his belongings and looking frightened, whispered to a nurse that he was being followed. A few patients moaned from their gurneys in the hallway, and one hid under a blanket, a human form in light blue. “If it looks tight, it’s because it is,” shrugged Kathryn Ballou, the nursing supervisor. “If it looks messy, it is.” The facility dates to 1976, and it seems a world away from the new, shiny wing of the hospital emblazoned with the name of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. But finally, the hospital’s psychiatric emergency services division is getting some love — and desperately needed money. Wednesday night is the annual Hearts in SF shindig, when a new set of those huge, colorful hearts that dot the city will be auctioned off. But this year there’s a twist. For the first time, the money raised from the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation’s event will go to a new fund dedicated solely to mental health care. As of Monday, the foundation had raised $3.8 million, including $1 million from Bank of America, which is nearly double the amount raised last year. The sold-out event is the latest sign that San Francisco is finally getting serious about dealing with  the mental health crisis  that plagues our sidewalks. Mayor London Breed has announced that  she’ll name a mental health director  and has created a task force to study the city’s  methamphetamine epidemic . State Sen. Scott Wiener successfully pushed for legislation to  expand who qualifies for conservatorship . They’re good steps, but a short visit to the psychiatric emergency room at S.F. General demonstrates that far more  needs to be done . Unlike the city’s homeless shelters — which had 1,098 people on the waiting list Monday afternoon — the psychiatric emergency room doesn’t turn anyone away. Sometimes people arrive in the middle of the night seeking shelter. Other people arrive — brought by ambulance, police officers, family or of their own volition — suffering from mood disorders, schizophrenia or drug and alcohol addictions. Some will be released quickly, often back to the streets because there are so few long-term care facilities. Others will be moved to the one of the 44 acute care beds upstairs in the hospital. At just about every level, from the emergency room to the acute care area to long-term care facilities, there are too few beds to adequately address the city’s  massive mental health crisis . While the emergency staff seems incredibly caring and competent, the emergency facility itself is bland, cramped and off-putting. “I don’t know how hopeful you felt walking through those doors, but it doesn’t create hope immediately,” said Dr. Anton Bland, medical director of the hospital’s psychiatric emergency services division. That’s an understatement. City voters passed a bond in 2016 that will help pay to move a wall between the psychiatric emergency room and an enormous lobby next door, giving the emergency room more space. (Whoever designed the old part of the hospital certainly had a thing for hulking lobbies and empty space.) Bland said one of his priorities for the new mental health care fund is to purchase new furniture and decor to make the psychiatric emergency room more calm and therapeutic. He also wants the fund to help patients afford private detox programs. Other plans include adding more social services to the facility and bringing the hospital’s new electronic health record-keeping system to the psychiatric emergency services division more quickly. Schuyler Hudak, a member of the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation’s board of directors, showed me around the hospital — the old and the new wings — on Monday. We’d walked through the new, immaculate building on our way to the psychiatric emergency room. The new building features murals, stained glass windows and a rooftop garden with sweeping views of the city. It’s bright, airy, spacious and doesn’t smell. “These patients here deserve the kind of space we were just in,” Hudak said once we were in the psychiatric E.R. “It’s pretty unconscionable that the wealthiest society in modern history is letting people live like this,” Hudak said of the hordes of mentally ill homeless people who cycle between the hospital and the streets. Pam Baer hopes to get the city talking about mental health. She’s the co-chair of the annual Hearts in SF event and is married to Giants president Larry Baer. She was ready to quit the time-intensive role of chair until the purpose shifted toward mental health. “We’ve honored trauma, we’ve honored orthopedics,” she explained. “The only way I would co-chair it this year is if the focus was on mental health. It’s dear to my heart.” That’s because she lost her nephew — her sister’s son — to suicide last year. His name was Noah, and he was  28. He was a photographer living in Baltimore who struggled with mental health issues. His death crushed the entire family. “I do feel that every one of us is touched in some way, whether it’s friends or family with anxiety or addictions or schizophrenia,” she said. “It humbles all of us. My goal is enabling a platform where we can talk about it and try to destigmatize it.” Several of the artists who designed this year’s hearts have ties to the mental health world, including Clint Imboden, who lives in Oakland and worked in mental health for more than 30 years before becoming a full-time artist. He did mental health screenings in a jail, worked in a psychiatric hospital and worked at suicide crisis centers, among other jobs. His heart features the names of hundreds of San Francisco streets — from the iconic like Lombard and Haight to tiny, little-known ones like Pink Alley in the Castro and Dolphin Court in Hunters Point. He said he likes painting because there’s a conclusion, a time at which his piece is finished. That was rarely the case with mental health patients. “I’d never know what ever happened with them,” he said. “They’d just cycle in and out. I could spend 12 hours with someone and never see them again. I would just assume that I’d put in my good work and done what I’d needed to do.”A dragnet focused on capturing wanted fugitives, drug dealers and other neighborhood nuisances resulted in 50 arrests in just hours in San Francisco’s Tenderloin, authorities said Thursday. San Francisco police, sheriff’s deputies and parole agents from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation conducted the operation over five hours Wednesday as part of a larger strategy to improve the quality-of-life issues in the drug-plagued district. Dubbed a “fugitive recovery operation,” officials arrested 38 people on outstanding warrants while busting the remaining 12 people on suspicion of other crimes ranging from drugs to burglary charges. “The community in the Tenderloin is very determined and organized to take their community back, and we’re doing everything we can to support that,” district station Capt. Carl Fabbri said. The operation was similar to an enforcement operation in October when police arrested 37 people in the neighborhood. Parts of the district, like Civic Center,  have seen welcomed improvements  in recent months, but the neighborhood is still criticized as being an open-air bazaar for drug dealers. Neighborhood streets are regularly strewn with doddering drug users, some passed out with needles still dangling from their arms. Shuffling among the troubled are families, school children and other residents who have grown frustrated over the seemingly intractable neighborhood problems. Many of the suspects arrested Wednesday had bench warrants after failing to appear in court for an earlier arrest, Fabbri said, while others violated a court order or committed different crimes. “There are families here. There are children. There are parks. There are people trying to run businesses, coming to and from work,” he said. “There is a strong community that really cares and there is a significant criminal element in the Tenderloin. We’re trying to get those people out of the community and to give the community some relief.” Officers typically arrest around 12 people a day in the neighborhood, officials said. In 2018, more than 600 people in the Tenderloin were booked for drug crimes of the 4,000 overall arrests. But many of the suspects are processed in the city’s jails and then released on conditions. Recent changes in the state’s bail system have led to an increase in people being released from jail before trial, allowing many back on the streets to sell drugs after just a few days behind bars, police said. Fabbri said his officers have been undeterred by the larger challenges in the criminal justice system. “All we can do is do our job and do it well,” he said. “Our role is to make those arrests. We’re not giving up. We’ll never give up on the fight to make the Tenderloin a better community.”President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency on the southern border was neither a good move nor a bad move. It was a Trump move. Trump made two commitments when he ran in 2016. He said: I’m going to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep criminals and drugs out of the U.S. And: I’m going to put Hillary Clinton away. He was halfway through his term and realized he had achieved neither of those goals. If you count his bluster that Mexico was going to pay for the wall, he was 0 for 3. As Trump would say, not good. Not good at all. So faced with a wall of opposition from Democrats now in control of the House, he pulled an end run. At least on paper and for the press. Yes, he probably has the power to  divert military funds to the border.  But there is no rush to do so, because it’s going to take some time to spend what Congress already gave him. He’s sure to build at least a couple of miles of concrete wall between now and November 2020, to have something he can point to. As for Hillary, Trump can turn to that commitment once his wall is completed. Which means never. The new Newsom:  Gov. Gavin Newsom’s first State of the State speech generated more national attention than any gubernatorial address I can recall. From the pre-speech leak that he was  pulling the National Guard out of President Trump’s border operation,  to the final salute to the heroic nurse who risked his life in the Paradise wildfire to save his patients, it carried the weight and tone of a presidential address. It also appeared to uncork eight years of paybacks to former Gov. Jerry Brown, who so often dissed Newsom when he was lieutenant governor. Newsom made a point of distancing himself from Brown on two key issues,  high-speed rail and the delta water tunnels.  With mixed results. Newsom’s confusing message on the future of high-speed rail backfired. His people insisted it didn’t really say what half the world thought it said: that he was giving up on extending the line out of the Central Valley. Fortunately for Newsom,  Trump bailed him out  by tweeting a refund demand for the feds’ money. That turned it into just another Trump versus the Resistance battle. What exactly the state will do about its bullet-train boondoggle returned to the back burner. Fire friendly:  Original Joe’s was party central the other night when Chris Gruwell of New Deal Advisers booked the place for a 500-person celebration of Shon Buford’s elevation to president of the firefighters union. Buford became the first African American to head the union. It’s been more than 50 years since Earl Gage broke the Fire Department’s color barrier — and that took a court order. It’s been a long road, but now Black History Month celebrations can include this new black achievement. Heart beat:  Judy Guggenhime and Pam Baer moved the Heroes & Hearts fundraiser from a midday lunch at the ballpark to an evening party at Pier 48. Why? More space was needed. Some of the notables attending included pro football Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott, ought-to-be baseball Hall of Famer Barry Bonds, former Police Chief Greg Suhr, former Secretary of State George Shultz and two significant contributors: Kaiser CEO Bernard Tyson and Dignity Health CEO Lloyd Dean. About $4.5 million was raised for San Francisco General Hospital. Breed achieves:  The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission’s annual Black History Month luncheon was moved from the Whitcomb Hotel to the Hilton, and attendance doubled. Mayor London Breed was presented with a lifetime achievement award. As she told commission General Manager Harlan Kelly, being given a lifetime achievement award by someone older than she is raises eyebrows, to say the least. Lean in:  My recent move to the Millennium Tower has meant taking apart and reassembling many pieces of furniture. It has been both a satisfying and disturbing task. It’s satisfying because after an hour of work, you get a chair put back together. Disturbing because inevitably when I’m done, I still have extra pieces. The good news is, given where I live, everything already tilts.An Internal Revenue Service analyst in San Francisco was the source of government records showing that Michael Cohen, when he was President Trump’s personal lawyer, funneled millions of dollars from foreign companies, as well as an alleged hush-money payment, into Cohen’s illegal shell company, federal prosecutors charged Thursday. John C. Fry, 54, of San Francisco was accused of unlawfully obtaining five “suspicious-activity reports” from a Treasury Department database last May and disclosing them to Michael Avenatti, a Newport Beach (Orange County) attorney, and later to a New Yorker magazine reporter. Avenatti represents porn film star Stormy Daniels, one of two women who said Trump paid them to keep silent before the 2016 election about their past sexual relationships. One of the payments Fry disclosed to Avenatti was an October 2016 transfer of $130,000 to a bank account controlled by Cohen, who said he paid that sum to Daniels. Cohen pleaded guilty in August to charges that included violating campaign finance laws by handling payments to influence the presidential election, and said he did so at Trump’s direction. Trump has denied it. Cohen has been sentenced to three years in prison and is due to testify to two congressional committees next week. But Fry is charged with leaking much more than a report of a single bank deposit. As reported by the Washington Post, in a story based on information from Avenatti, and by the New Yorker from conversations with Fry, Cohen transferred at least $3 million into one or more accounts of Essential Services, a company he controlled, between 2016 and 2018. Deposits included $500,000 from Columbus Nova, a company affiliated with a Russian oligarch, which also donated to Trump‘s inauguration fund in January 2017, prosecutors said. The New Yorker said Fry, whom the magazine identified as an anonymous source, described deposits of hundreds of thousands of dollars from companies seeking access to the Trump administration, including AT&T and drug manufacturer Novartis. In addition, the magazine said, Fry reported that Cohen had falsely told one bank he was using his account for real estate services from U.S. clients, for modest sums, when he actually was receiving large amounts from foreign entities. Fry met with federal agents in November and admitted providing the restricted information to Avenatti and the New Yorker reporter, according to an affidavit by Treasury Department agent Linda Cieslak. Suspicious-activity reports, from banks and other sources, are kept by the Treasury Department in a confidential file, and are supposed to be inaccessible even to IRS employees like Fry who are not involved in the investigation. The New Yorker reporter, Ronan Farrow, said Fry explained that he revealed the clandestine information after discovering that some of it had been withheld from federal investigators. “This is a permanent record,” Farrow quoted Fry as saying. “They should be there, and there is nothing there.” Cieslak’s affidavit said Fry illegally accessed five reports using the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and Palantir. Fry then called Avenatti, and continued searching for other incriminating reports using Cohen’s driver’s license and Social Security numbers, according to court documents. After hearing from Fry, Avenatti tweeted a dossier with the information in May, commenting that “Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen have a lot of explaining to do.” Reports detailing Cohen’s transactions were published the same day in the Washington Post, and eight days later in the New Yorker, prosecutors said. Fry faces a sentence of up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted of all charges. He appeared before a federal magistrate Thursday and was released on $50,000 bond until his next court appearance March 13. His lawyer, Gail Shifman, did not reply to requests for comment.A lawsuit by San Francisco challenging the Trump administration’s withdrawal of guidelines on issues affecting poor and disabled people has been dismissed by a federal judge, who said the city could not show how it would be harmed by the repeal. The Justice Department guidelines, issued during the final years of the Obama presidency, included standards for state and local courts to avoid disproportionately harming poor people when imposing criminal fines. Another set of standards addressed compliance with a Supreme Court ruling requiring state and local governments to allow disabled people to live in their own homes or group homes and share workplaces with able-bodied workers. Further guidelines advised employers on compliance with laws banning job discrimination based on national origin. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions withdrew the guidelines in December 2017 after President Trump ordered an overall reduction in federal regulations. Sessions offered only a general explanation for his action, saying the repealed guidelines were “unnecessary, inconsistent with existing law, or otherwise improper.” The city’s lawsuit,  filed in April, accused Sessions of violating a federal law that requires the government to engage in “reasoned decision-making” and provide meaningful explanations for actions that have legal consequences. In dismissing the suit on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar did not address the legality of the Trump administration’s actions, but instead cited his earlier ruling that San Francisco lacked legal standing to mount the legal challenge. City lawyers argued that the repeal of guidelines protecting poor defendants from excessive fines would harm San Francisco by impoverishing more of its residents and making them more dependent on local public services. Tigar said the argument was speculative and did not show the likelihood of an impact on city government. “The city cannot simply claim a concrete interest in the financial well-being of all potential future residents,” the judge said. He also said San Francisco could not show that it faced federal enforcement action, or other tangible harm, from the withdrawal of guidelines interpreting laws that protect the disabled and the foreign-born. John Coté, spokesman for City Attorney Dennis Herrera, said Tigar’s ruling does not resolve the legality of the Trump administration’s rollback of “rights for the poor, people of color, people with disabilities and others.” “The court ruled that San Francisco does not have the legal standing to sue for those violations,” Coté said. “Somebody else could — and we hope they do.”San Francisco’s auto burglary epidemic hit a new and disturbing low over the weekend when someone broke into a man’s car and stole his prosthetic arm, police said Tuesday. The incident happened around 6 p.m. Saturday on Cleveland Street, an alley in the South of Market neighborhood between Victoria Manalo Draves Park and Seventh Street, near the Hall of Justice. The crook, who was not identified or arrested, broke into the 41-year-old victim’s vehicle and stole his prosthetic arm, police wrote in a brief report on the incident. Officials initially said a prosthetic leg was stolen but later corrected their report. The break-in follows a troubling trend of smash-and-grabs, including an incident last month when  a couple’s car was burglarized  while they took wedding photos at the 16th Avenue mosaic steps in the Sunset District. Days later, a man committed another burglary at the same location while three victims were still sitting inside the vehicle. The Chronicle last week launched the  S.F. Car Break-In Tracker,  a tool for readers to see — in near-real-time — the locations of every reported car burglary around the city. While the crimes continue to plague the city, the number of reported incidents has steadily decreased since  hitting an all-time high  of 31,067 car break-ins in 2017. Auto burglaries dropped 17 percent in 2018 and have continued to trend down this year, according to the Police Department’s statistics. The first five weeks of the year have seen a 32 percent drop compared to the same period in 2018, police said.The holiday season is here, and donors are looking to contribute in a charitable way to people in need of emergency assistance. Since 1986, The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing Fund has become an integral part of that effort by helping to provide for more than 150,000 individuals and families around the Bay Area. As one of the largest financial contributors to food banks in the Bay Area, the Season of Sharing Fund offers support to those struggling with the costs of severe illness, displacement and loss of work. Throughout the years, the program has also helped those facing rising housing costs as well as people impacted by wildfires. Most of the funds (85 percent) go toward family needs while the remaining 15 percent is distributed among food banks in the nine Bay Area counties. This year, the program has served about 4,500 individuals and families. Within those families, 4,300 children were helped. Assistance is also available to veterans, individuals with disabilities, senior citizens and domestic violence victims. “It’s The Chronicle’s job to inspire, educate and inform — but through Season of Sharing we are able to do even more,” said Audrey Cooper, editor in chief of the San Francisco Chronicle. “We can change people’s lives. It’s hard to get by in the Bay Area today, and too often just a little help can mean the difference between a family staying housed or ending up on the street. Our readers are the most generous in the country, and together we can help all members thrive in our community.” The operation costs are fully covered by the San Francisco Chronicle and the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund with 100 percent of the donations received going directly to help communities in need.

Box 44740 San Francisco, CA 94144Even though  President Trump  and congressional Democrats reached a deal to reopen the federal government through Feb. 15, San Francisco officials are still looking to provide some relief to workers impacted by the record-long shutdown. Mayor  London Breed  is expected to introduce legislation with Supervisor  Matt Haney  on Tuesday that would authorize city Treasurer  José  Cisneros  to create a $20 million fund that an estimated 2,000 federal workers living in San Francisco could tap for zero-interest loans of up to $6,000 each. “When federal workers are forced to go without pay due to a federal shutdown, we can and will step in to help these workers take care of themselves and their families,” Breed said in a statement. The fund is one option the mayor and treasurer’s office have been working on for several days to help out federal workers, who were at risk of missing a second paycheck Friday.  On Monday , Haney called on the mayor and city agencies to consider “immediately provide assistance to impacted federal employees.” “This is a significant and immediate solution to support impacted workers who are worried about how they can pay the bills,” Haney said. The loans would also be available for about 1,300 San Francisco International Airport workers who live outside the city, but receive a paycheck from the federal government for their work at a city-run operation. That wouldn’t apply to airport safety screeners, who work for a private contractor, not the federal government. The mayor and Haney plan to introduce the legislation at Tuesday’s Board of Supervisors meeting. The proposed legislation calls for the loans to be repaid no later than 60 days after the federal government fully reopens. “I am committed to helping federal workers avoid turning to predatory payday loans,” Cisneros said.James Logan High School in Union City was placed on lockdown late Friday morning after a student was reported stabbed on the school\\'s campus, police said. Officers were investigating the situation and trying to locate the suspect, the Union City Police Department wrote in a Nixle alert posted shortly after 11 a.m. ALSO :  Napa sheriff releases footage of deadly shooting during traffic stop \"Union City Police Department is at James Logan investigating a student being stabbed while at school. Officers are clearing the school and attempting to locate the suspect at this time. Please avoid responding to the school until the lockdown has been lifted to allow officers to continue to investigate the situation,\" police said. NBC News was reporting that the stabbing occurred in the high school bathroom. James Logan is the only public high school in Union City and serves about 3,600 students, according to the school district. As of 12:25 p.m., students were writing on social media that the school was still on lockdown. By 1:27 p.m., police wrote that the lockdown had been lifted and a suspect in the stabbing, a juvenile, had been arrested. \"Students will be released from school at the regular release time at 3:20pm,\" police wrote. Students reported on social media that shortly after the hours-long lockdown was lifted, someone pulled a fire alarm.On day two of their job, most supervisors are arranging furniture, hanging pictures and figuring out the city’s email system. Matt Haney, on the other hand, was spinning conspiracy theories. As we recorded the latest episode of the  Chronicle podcast “San Francisco City Insider,”  one answer in particular proved surprising. I asked him if it’s fair to call his District Six — the Tenderloin, Mid-Market and South of Market — a containment zone for the city’s ills. Is City Hall OK with  open-air injection drug use and dealing,  human feces and dirty needles on the sidewalks, homeless camps and general filth as long as the misery doesn’t spill over the district’s borders? Yes, that’s the case, he said. And it’s even worse than that. “It’s a conspiracy, and everybody’s in on it,” he said. Wait, what? Was he being sarcastic? Nope. “I do think it’s a conspiracy,” he repeated. “The fact that we’ve accepted that reality without the level of urgency and creativity and relentlessness from our city apparatus, I think suggests that there’s been some recognition that it’s going to be that way, and that City Hall’s OK with that ... “If you were shooting up in the Marina or Noe Valley, I actually think there would be a response and something would happen,” he continued. “It’s bureaucratic indifference and inertia, and I will challenge that.” His insistence made me think. The word “conspiracy” conjures images of Mayor London Breed, the police chief and other leaders chuckling in a darkened back room at City Hall as they agree to ignore the crime and human misery in the Tenderloin and SoMa if it means continued voter support from nicer neighborhoods. Maybe they’re tossing back whiskey shots as they hatch their evil plans. I assure you that’s not happening. Breed has devoted her attention to District Six, ordering more frequent street cleaning and sending in  the new Poop Patrol,  installing better streetlights  and trash cans,  boosting police foot patrols and demanding drug dealers be arrested. “That’s my focus and my administration’s focus, and any suggestion otherwise is ridiculous,” she said. But I also understand Haney’s point. If I were raising my boys in the Tenderloin — the neighborhood with the most children per capita in the entire city — I would be irate. I’d be mad that drug dealers openly hawk their wares outside the children’s playground at Boeddeker Park and, if arrested, are often released very quickly, only to return to the same spot. I’d be mad that my children would have to dodge people who are high out of their minds or extremely mentally ill and never get much long-term help from City Hall. I’d be mad my kids would need to  skip over dirty needles and piles of excrement  like other kids skip rope. And worst of all, I’d know that if this scene were dropped like a weird sci-fi movie into Noe Valley or Cole Valley, it would not be allowed to fester. No way. “We have low-income families and residents and seniors, and they are pissed,” Haney said. “We’re not just talking about the condo folks who are also pissed. My folks in the Tenderloin are the most pissed!” Haney, too, is pissed. For five years, he’s rented an apartment on Hyde Street in the Tenderloin — on the very stretch the New York Times recently named  the dirtiest block in San Francisco. Shortly before Christmas, I attended a community meeting some longtime SoMa residents and small business owners arranged with Haney, weeks before he was even on the job. Jeremiah Almond, wearing a Santa hat, talked about the  difficulty of running a small business in the area.  He operates a printing company out of a building he owns on Howard Street and rents out two other commercial spaces. But one of those has been vacant for a year because potential tenants keep being turned off by the misery outside. “I don’t want to say scuzzy or scummy, but it’s pretty disgusting,” he said, noting people inject needles into their feet outside, deal drugs, pitch tents and drop their pants to relieve themselves right outside his glass windows. He coined the phrase “standing zombies” for the people who are high on drugs and appear to be asleep but remain standing, swaying side to side. “What do they call it with air quotes? A world-class city? More like a world-class problem city,” the San Francisco native lamented, saying he calls the police regularly, and they usually just shrug. Joel Smith, an architect who’s lived on Tehama Street for 12 years, said he’d been most bothered by the huge uptick in open-air drug use in the past couple of years, with people shooting up in his doorway and leaving their needles on the sidewalk. He recently found a bag with hundreds of dirty needles inside and took it to a local needle exchange. “They’re not abashed or ashamed about it at all,” he said of drug users. “They do it out in the open, and when they’re confronted, they say, ‘Yeah, what are you going to do about it?’” Smith, in turn, wants to know what Haney is going to do about it. He and many residents in District Six think former Supervisor Jane Kim ignored their complaints in favor of headline-making moves such as working for free City College and a higher minimum wage. Haney promised to be different from his predecessor. “I’m looking forward and turning the page to be a neighborhood supervisor working on micro-issues, block by block,” Haney told the group. “The status quo in District Six is completely unacceptable. It’s unfathomable. We are going to be relentless on bringing about change.” Kim, who is taking time off before deciding her next professional move, told me it’s common for supervisors to start off focused on neighborhood concerns and then shift to addressing citywide problems. She said she was able to handle both and pointed to a new, protected bike lane on Howard Street as a recent neighborhood improvement she guided. As for Haney’s conspiracy theory, Kim said City Hall directs myriad resources to the district. “But it’s not enough,” she said. “Do I think certain behavior is more accepted in our district? Absolutely. The open air drug dealing is a great example of that.” In our podcast interview, Haney listed some examples of changes he wants to see — far more drug outreach workers roaming the streets of District Six and a program to encourage injection drug users to return their dirty needles. “People return cans and get 5 cents, right?” he said. He also wants Breed to select a site in every district for a homeless Navigation Center rather than continuing to build the enhanced shelters only in Districts Six, Nine and 10. Breed’s spokesman said her administration is actively looking for additional sites around the city. One thing’s for sure, Haney has the toughest job of any new city supervisor. And if he sticks with his outspokenness on the wretchedness of his district, he’s going to make life for the mayor and other City Hall leaders plenty tough too.Moving gingerly because of his bad back, Mike Dennis pulled himself into the driver’s seat of his green Ford Ranger pickup and reclined the seat. “This is how I slept for months,” he said. “I’d take off my shoes and wrap up in a sleeping bag and comforter.” Nowadays, the pickup is in the parking lot of a tidy seniors apartment complex in Santa Rosa, which Dennis moved into in September with the help of The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing. “I’m so grateful to have a roof over my head,” he said, opening the door to a one-bedroom unit strewn with tools from his former trades as a machinist and toolmaker. It’s been almost two decades since Dennis, 69, became disabled on the job, throwing out his back from the constant hunching over a workbench. That led to a years-long ordeal with nine surgeries that removed some discs and fused some vertebrae, leaving him almost 4 inches shorter than when he’d started. Now 5 feet, 11 inches tall, he walks with the careful precision of someone in constant pain. He lost his life savings, including 401(k) retirement money, when he bought a house before the housing market collapsed, not realizing that his adjustable-rate loan would soar to unaffordable heights just as real estate values cratered. He had to sell the house for less than he owed on the mortgage, a transaction called a short sale. Still, he was able to afford the rent on a cottage with a workshop, where he ran a little business repairing fishing reels “to supplement my pittance from Social Security,” he said. “I’ve always been an avid outdoorsman and fisherman, and I was doing a decent business just by word of mouth.” But two years ago, the landlord raised the rent beyond what Dennis could afford. He rang up credit card debt trying to keep up, and ended up homeless. He “bounced around” — sleeping in his truck for months at a time, house-sitting, subletting a room, and living in a homeless shelter. For 32 years, The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing Fund has helped more than 150,000 Bay Area individuals and families facing unexpected life crises. Want to help?

While he was living in the truck, he visited a community church in Sebastopol asking for tips on a safe place to park. The church let him sleep in his truck in its parking lot and provided a place to shower. To show his appreciation for that help, he would bring leftover food that he received from the county food bank to the church’s food pantry. That’s how he met social worker Joanne Matson, whom he calls his guardian angel. “One day I saw Michael putting stuff in the food donation box in the vestibule,” she said. “He was homeless and living in his truck, but he’d collect food and donate to other people as a little ministry of his own. He was paying back. That says a lot about a person.” Matson helped Dennis get into a shelter last year during the cold winter months. The shelter helped fast-track him for a Section 8 voucher for a housing subsidy, something that otherwise has a multiple-year waiting list. Section 8 pays the lion’s share of his rent, leaving him with an amount manageable on his Social Security. But he didn’t have money for move-in costs. That’s where Season of Sharing stepped in. The nonprofit, which provides one-time funds to people in crises, covered his security deposit and initial month’s rent. He had enough money left over to buy a mattress at Costco and is relieved every time he lies down on a real bed rather than his truck’s front seat. He’s thankful to be able to eat food he cooked himself in his kitchen. “I’m so grateful every time I wash my dishes,” he said.In the early years of their marriage, moving was easy. Back then, Henry and Astrid Granger were hungry to create a life together. That was more than 40 years ago, before the Tubbs Fire destroyed their Santa Rosa home and the world they had built within its walls. Before everything stopped being new. They weren’t young anymore. Moving wasn’t exciting — it was a chore. But, as autumn 2017 bled into winter, it’s what they had to do. At least they didn’t have much to pack, Henry thought. The fire had seen to that when it destroyed their Coffey Park neighborhood in the early hours of Oct. 9. They were relocating from their daughter’s Oakland apartment to a rental off Dutton Avenue in Santa Rosa until they could purchase a new home. Astrid didn’t want to rebuild in Coffey Park, and, as was usually the case, Henry deferred to her. The town house had a yellow front door, which Henry found cheerful. Astrid bought a doormat emblazoned with their initial, “G.” Some former Coffey Park neighbors lived in the same complex. They tended to have glazed stares and didn’t converse much. Rent was $3,100 a month, and the Grangers’ insurance would pay it for up to two years. Henry didn’t intend to stay in the rental that long. All those years before, he had promised his wife everything — comfort, safety, stability. Those were the sweet assurances of youth, before age whittled him down and then the fire knocked him flat. The vows he had made to Astrid, the woman who had moved around the world for him, were no longer ones this man in his 70s knew how to fulfill. They had fallen in love in Germany. He was 37 and divorced, a sergeant on his third tour of the country after stints in Vietnam and South Korea. She was 22 and stocking shelves at a big-box store. They met at the disco where American soldiers stationed in Giessen, an hour’s drive north of Frankfurt, danced on their nights off. Astrid used to hitchhike there to meet dashing  GIs . Henry was handsome and muscled. She was sharp and lithe. They began dating and, when his tour ended a year later, she followed him to California. Both of their families were bewildered. His two children from an earlier marriage were just five and six years younger than Astrid. Now he was marrying a woman he met in a club who could practically be their sister. Her parents liked that Henry was older and drove a big car — it conveyed a sense of stability for their only daughter. But when Henry was shipped back to the U.S., and Astrid went with him, that broke their hearts. Henry and Astrid Granger pose for a portrait in 1984, three years before they moved to Santa Rosa’s Coffey Park. Astrid had always been bold and impetuous. When she was 18, she moved to London to be a nanny for a family living near Piccadilly Circus. She waitressed in their pub some afternoons, serving kidney pie and mashed potatoes to entertainment executives. It was an adventure. So was life in the United States. She and Henry married at Monterey City Hall in 1978. They had no one to invite — his family was in Alabama, hers in Germany, and they had just moved to Pacific Grove in Monterey County. A neighbor snapped a photo of the couple, dressed in their nicest clothes, in front of their small home. Astrid couldn’t afford a wedding dress. Afterward, they drove along the scenic 17-Mile Drive and stopped for dinner on Cannery Row. Astrid got pregnant right away and, within a few years, another child followed. She got her green card and became an American citizen, before she fully understood all that she was sacrificing: heritage, family, identity. Henry might have moved back to Alabama, where his family was, but Astrid had been to the Deep South with him and hated it. If Astrid had her way they would have returned to Germany; her parents were growing older. But Henry’s post-Army jobs piloting airplanes for a cattle rancher and driving county buses were here. California was their compromise. A place foreign to both of them became their new home. When their firstborn, Audrey, was a toddler, they moved to Goshen, near Visalia in Tulare County, for Henry’s pilot job. He was between paychecks, and after the couple paid the $3,000 housing deposit, they couldn’t afford many groceries. For three weeks, they existed on eggs, bread and Henry’s leftover military C-rations. They didn’t care, as long as they had a home and each other. They were happy. Ollie Geissinger during a stay at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital. Ollie’s health problems, including heart and intestinal issues, have had him in and out of the hospital since his birth.  The baby splayed like a starfish, his tiny arms and legs quivering under a mess of tubes and wires. A thick scar bisected his chest. Cole Geissinger had known fatherhood would be difficult. But never this  difficult .  Bruises bloomed on his son’s soft skin where nurses had tried to insert intravenous lines. Blankets rolled up like burritos pinned Apollo — Ollie, as they nicknamed him — so he wouldn’t turn over and pull out all the tethers to his medical equipment. Ollie’s tiny cry sounded like a kitten’s mewling. Cole stroked his arms and wispy hair. He traced the gold, heart-shaped sensor taped to the 1-month-old’s stomach. Monitors softly beeped. His wife, Melissa, leaned against him. “You’re doing a great job, little dude,” Cole said to his son. Cole and Melissa had known about their baby’s heart problem since August 2017, two months before they lost their home in the Tubbs Fire and four months before Ollie was born. Actually, problems: an obstructed ventricle, a mismatched aorta sprouting from the wrong ventricle and a hole in his heart. During a routine ultrasound, the technician had spotted something off. There was a 99 percent chance everything would be fine, he said. But that’s not how it worked out. After Ollie was born on Dec. 20, doctors at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital in San Francisco sliced open his chest to install a shunt, increasing blood flow to his lungs. That had gone according to plan. A week later, a portion of his small intestine died, a condition called necrotizing enterocolitis. It was unrelated to the heart problem. Cole Geissinger gently touches his day-old son’s forehead at the hospital in San Francisco. On postsurgery scans, doctors had noted dark shadows accumulating in the labyrinthine folds of Ollie’s digestive system and rushed him into surgery. They removed the dead part of his intestine and looped what was left out of a hole they cut in his belly. Melissa and Cole had been ready to deal with the heart problems, but not this, and it smacked them hard. Now the baby was embarking on a hospital stay that would last more than two months. Cole was wrong every time he thought things couldn’t get worse. With every hit, it became harder to bounce back. He and Melissa hadn’t been able to work consistently in months. She wanted to be a writer. But she had stopped writing. He used to have hobbies and spend time with friends. Not anymore. Ollie had become his life. His temper flared. Just  once , he wondered, could they catch a break? At least he had Melissa. A framed portrait of Cole and Melissa Geissinger from a trip to Denver in 2014.  Their marriage had struggled in the two years following her miscarriage. They were enmeshed in separate grief cycles and couldn’t reach each other, until she became pregnant with Ollie. When the obstetrician detected the heart problems, she asked them if they wanted to terminate the pregnancy. Of course not — they would work as a team to make a plan. Cole studied anatomical heart diagrams online. He talked with doctors. He became an expert on the condition he knew would dictate his son’s early years. He called the insurance company. Ollie’s health costs would be astronomical, upward of $3 million. Some of it would be covered, but not all of it. Cole realized that even with the house insurance payoff, he and Melissa might not be able to rebuild the home where they had planned to raise their child. Ollie squirmed in his bassinet. He was alive. That was enough. Where was Henry? Astrid was cooking lunch in the kitchen of their rental home just before New Year’s Eve. Her husband had left for the Santa Rosa Veterans Affairs clinic a few hours before. She glanced at the digital clock on the oven. Usually, he was home by now. Home — this place still wasn’t home. But it finally felt comfortable. Astrid had printed and framed new photos: her daughter, Audrey, dressed in white lace on her wedding day; her son, Jeff, seated at a Mexican restaurant; her niece holding her newborn child. Astrid had nailed cuckoo clocks onto the living room wall, replicas of the ones she lost in the fire. Their muted chirping on the hour was familiar and soothing. Her friends had donated appliances, things that wouldn’t sell at their garage sales. The town house had otherwise come furnished, though the bedsheets were starched and stiff. Astrid bought new linen from a department store that offered a discount to fire victims. There was one surviving tchotchke from Coffey Park: a blue tile, discolored and singed. It showed a Dutch ship cutting through roiling waves. Ever-moving, frozen mid-crest. Astrid duct-taped it near the kitchen sink. How small things became big things! She had already lost so much, even before the Tubbs Fire. Astrid Granger, in a rented town house after she and her husband lost their house in the Tubbs Fire, says, “You put decades into a home. It would never be the same.” Just  once , she wondered, could she catch a break? As a child, Astrid had fled East Germany with her parents and two brothers. The world’s Western and Eastern powers cut the country in half during the Cold War, and her family was trapped on the wrong side of history. They had been living on her grandparents’ farm in Reinstedt, a village 140 miles southwest of Berlin. Just a child, Astrid was oblivious to geopolitics. She loved it there — she climbed trees and forded streams without supervision. She felt free. It was an idyllic childhood her own son and daughter wouldn’t have growing up in a city in the United States, even one as tame as Santa Rosa. “There’s something wrong with your ears,” her mother began telling Astrid when she was 4, even though she could hear perfectly. Her parents had falsified medical documents claiming they needed to travel to Frankfurt in West Germany for treatment or Astrid would go deaf. No one knew they had booked one-way tickets — a train to Berlin, then a flight to Frankfurt. They left everything they owned behind. Six months later, in August 1961, the Berlin Wall went up. They arrived in Frankfurt poor and dispossessed, and moved into a refugee camp with thousands of other people. Her parents got jobs in a factory that produced metal cables. Astrid’s mother — who fled Silesia, now part of Poland, during World War II — carved out a new life for her family, instilling a strength in her daughter that never wavered. In photos, she holds Astrid, small and puny, her arms emaciated compared with her twin brother’s rolls of flesh. Astrid had been a sickly child, and in those photos her cleft feet are bound in plaster casts. She’s rarely smiling. But her chin is cocked defiantly. Astrid and Henry Granger decorated their fridge in a Santa Rosa rental with personal photos after the Tubbs Fire consumed their home.  There were other photos, too. Gone now, incinerated. Her daughter, Audrey, in a blue flowered dress standing in the front yard of their home in Coffey Park. Her children playing in the local park, a few adults picnicking at tables in the background. The trees are young and small, not the flaming torches they would become when the Tubbs Fire rampaged through the neighborhood. That was so long ago. The memories were blurred and distant now, almost like they had happened to someone else. Astrid finished preparing lunch. She fed birdseed to the ravens living in their tiny backyard. The cuckoo clocks chimed, marking another lost hour. She waited for Henry to come home. They would show photos of this moment to Ollie someday, when he was older and stronger. Because someday, he would be older and stronger, Melissa thought. In May, they returned to the hospital for a second open heart surgery. His recovery took two weeks, and now they were being discharged. They were headed home to Melissa’s parents’ place in Sebastopol. They had barely spent time there in the past seven months, instead shuttling between the hospital and Family House, a long-term hotel for parents of children with chronic health problems. Their clothes smelled like antisepetic — the calling card of hospitals. Melissa pressed a pink sticker onto a wall in the cardiac transitional care unit. More than 100 other stickers bordered it — markers of hope and anguish. Leaving a message on the wall was a rite of passage for families being discharged. We were  here,  the wall signified.   Our love and our pain happened in this place. This was our life. Melissa Geissinger snuggles her son, Ollie, at UCSF Benioff Children\\'s Hospital.  Cole drew a spaceship on the sticker, floating next to a moon and a field of stars. “Thank you, CTCU,” he wrote. “We love you.” Signed, Apollo G. Melissa peeled off the sensors taped to Ollie’s skin, until he looked like a normal 5-month-old baby again. Only the feeding tube sprouting from his nose and the oxygen monitor Velcroed on one foot remained. She dressed him in a cotton onesie and double-checked his list of medications. It filled two pages. How had their lives gone so wrong? Her life with Cole had once been easy, the way romance had never been before for Melissa, who was strong-willed and stubborn. They were introduced through a mutual friend in early 2011 at a tech meet-up in Santa Rosa. She knew that Cole was kind and helpful, and engaged to another woman. So they became friends. After a month in Europe, Melissa returned that summer to the North Bay. Cole and his fiancee had broken up. He and Melissa went on an outing with friends to the California Academy of Sciences. He flirted with her, and she flirted back. Within three months, they had moved in to a 450-square-foot apartment above a garage. They got a cat and named  her Ascii, the acronym for the computer alphabet. They were nerdy. They didn’t fight, ever. Two years later, they got married on a dairy farm in Petaluma. In February, during Ollie’s first hospital stay, Melissa had driven up Highway 1 to Schoolhouse Beach near Bodega Bay. The sunset was bold and endless. A man paddle-boarded across the water with his dog. She went to dinner alone and drank red wine at the bar. She talked with some strangers. They didn’t know about her loss. They didn’t know about her sick child. For a few hours, she pretended things had turned out differently. She was just a mother — not one whose child refused to breast-feed or take a bottle, forcing her to measure every milliliter of formula poured into his feeding tube. Melissa Geissinger works on her laptop while keeping an eye on son, Ollie, at her parents’ Sebastopol home in April. Melissa and husband, Cole, moved in with her parents after their Santa Rosa home was destroyed in the Tubbs Fire. Just a homeowner. Not one who was a fire victim, who regularly drove through Coffey Park, measuring the progress of other homes going up on Astaire Court and hoping hers would soon be among them. Just a wife. Not one who suffered anxiety attacks in the middle of the night, whose husband had to hold her until the cold chills subsided. Not one ensnared in the sharp teeth of post-traumatic stress disorder. But now it was May, and on this day, she didn’t need to pretend. Ollie was being discharged. It was a good day. “Congratulations! Goodbye!” said the front desk nurse. “Ollie is out of here,” Melissa told her. “See you a really long time from now, hopefully.” Henry’s legs ached and cramped. Then they went numb. The air felt viscous, like he was walking underwater. He drove more than 60 miles from Santa Rosa to San Francisco, where the local Veterans Affairs hospital was, and checked into the emergency room. “Go see your primary care physician,” the doctor said. “Everything seems fine.” Another 60 miles, back to Santa Rosa. He dragged himself across the parking lot, struggling to breathe. “This isn’t a hospital,” the physician said. “You need to go to a hospital.” Another 60 miles, back to San Francisco. In Santa Rosa, Astrid continued making lunch. Henry couldn’t feel his left leg. He poked it. Nothing. This time, doctors rushed him into a hospital room and hooked him to whirring machines. The electronic lines on their display screens went haywire — steep peaks and plummeting valleys. Henry was having a massive heart attack. Henry Granger, who suffered a heart attack in the aftermath of losing his home to the Tubbs Fire in 2017, works out at 24 Hour Fitness in Santa Rosa.  A hospital receptionist called their daughter first. The damn fire — it was destroying her parents. Audrey called her mother. In Santa Rosa, Astrid’s phone rang, slicing the silence. Surgeons inserted stents through Henry’s left wrist to help carry blood away from his heart. He would stay at the VA Hospital in San Francisco for  two weeks. More tests. A second procedure. Nurses ran out of healthy veins to puncture, and his arms bruised a blotchy black. Doctors came every day, crowding into his room. Where do you hurt? How are you feeling? What is your pain on a scale from 1 to 10? Over and over. He got fed up with their badgering. From the hospital room window, Henry could see the ocean, and he stared at the unwavering blue line on the horizon for hours. There wasn’t much else  to  do. “The way they are treating me here, I could do better at home,” Henry grumbled. “This is a bit too much.” As Astrid pulled out of their rental’s parking lot with her daughter one afternoon, upset and distracted, she turned in front of an oncoming car. The airbags deployed, and white dust pirouetted through the air like ash. Astrid and Audrey were unharmed. Her car was totaled. How had their lives gone so wrong? If Henry died, what would Astrid do? Maybe she wouldn’t need a new home. It didn’t make sense for a widow to live alone in a space that big. She sold their lot in Coffey Park for $145,000 — far less than what it was worth, even though there was no house and the neighborhood was in a burn zone. Henry went along with it. An acquaintance had reached out, saying she wanted to be near her mother, who had Parkinson’s disease. Coffey Park was close by. Astrid’s goal wasn’t to make the most money she could off a sale. That’s not who she is. “Someone else would have given me more,” she said. “But it wouldn’t be right.” Kindness was her tenet. She did right by people, hoping they would do right by her, too. Maybe this would bring them luck. It had been so long since anything had been easy. Any one of their traumas alone would have knocked them to their knees. The fire. The move. The surgeries. The car accident. Together, they seemed insurmountable. As spring blossomed in Santa Rosa, everyone else was moving on. Everyone but them. The “Sonoma County Strong” posters disappeared from shop windows. The city finished clearing thousands of lots in Coffey Park and beyond. The tangible signs of destruction — proof of what they had endured — were disappearing. Henry Granger and wife, Astrid, embrace as they stand on the destroyed property that was their home before the Tubbs Fire tore through Coffey Park in Santa Rosa. One year ago, more than a dozen fires shot to life in the North Bay. One of them, the Tubbs Fire, would become the most destructive wildfire in California history, killing 24 people and incinerating entire neighborhoods in and around Santa Rosa. One of those was Coffey Park. Henry and Astrid Granger, who had lived there for 30 years, and Melissa and Cole Geissinger, residents for just two years, survived the fire but lost all they had. In the year since the fire, The Chronicle’s Lizzie Johnson has spent hundreds of hours with the two couples to report this story, witnessing some of the most intimate, heartbreaking and joyous moments as they rebuilt their lives.

Email:  ljohnson@sfchronicle.com  Twitter:  @LizzieJohnsonnn Tubbs Fire survivors find new ways forwardAnybody who’s ever had a baby knows how grueling those first few months can be. The sleepless nights. The constant feedings. The nagging feeling you should have bought stock in Pampers. But one new dad in San Francisco is making life with an infant even harder on himself. And he’s doing it on purpose. Connor Skelly, 29, has upped the degree of difficulty by a factor of 10 by opting to take his son, Finn, on every Muni line in San Francisco. Skelly is a loyal Chronicle subscriber (the best kind of San Franciscan there is), and he followed along on that April day when Chronicle pop culture critic Peter Hartlaub and I  temporarily lost our sanity  and  rode all 60 Muni lines  in just over 18 hours. “I love San Francisco, I love maps, and I love public transportation,” Skelly said. “I thought, ‘Shoot, I wonder if I can rope a buddy into trying to replicate this.’” He apparently didn’t have success persuading any grown-ups to join him in his desire to  re-create #TotalMuni2018 . But there was one fellow who couldn’t say no because he can’t yet say anything at all. Finn Skelly — a chubby-cheeked, good-natured little boy — was born in August and soon became the perfect #TotalMuni companion. Every day, they tackle a few more lines, Finn sporting his signature hat with bunny ears and Skelly pushing him in a stroller laden with diapers, wipes, bottles and all the other requisite baby gear. They keep track of their progress on a chalkboard and Muni map mounted just inside the front door of their tiny one-bedroom Nob Hill apartment. As of Monday, they’d completed 43 of Muni’s 60 lines, with one month of Skelly’s four-month paternity leave left to go. He’s taking time off from his job as a consultant to stay home with Finn and next month will swap with his wife, Kristy Skelly, also 29, who will take maternity leave from her job at a health care company. Kristy said she will definitely not be spending her maternity leave tackling the #TotalMuni challenge but supports her husband’s undertaking. After all, their apartment is little and doesn’t get much light, and this gets the duo outside every day, exploring new corners of the city. “It’s good for Finn to be out,” said Kristy, who joins them for as many bus rides as she can. “It’s a good way for them to bond.” She said she wasn’t too worried about Finn’s immune system — sure to be invincible after #TotalMuni — but she did veto two lines: the 90-San Bruno Owl and the 91-Third Street/19th Ave. Owl, which run only in the middle of the night. “We’re having enough trouble getting him to sleep through the night as it is,” Connor Skelly explained. Hartlaub and I met up with Connor and Finn last week to ride the 12-Folsom/Pacific from downtown to near The Chronicle building at Fifth and Mission streets to record a podcast. Finn set two podcast records: becoming the youngest podcast guest in Chronicle history and the first ever to poop during a recording. This column doesn’t usually give kudos to city politicians, but here’s an exception. The Skellys couldn’t have taken on this challenge had it not been for two city laws, one championed by state Sen. Scott Wiener and the other by Assemblyman David Chiu, both back when the San Francisco Democrats were city supervisors. Wiener made San Francisco the first city in the country to require employers to  give employees who are new parents fully paid bonding time , which studies have shown is encouraging more dads to take time off after their babies are born. Skelly said his leave wouldn’t have been financially doable without the law. Chiu pushed a law  requiring Muni to allow strollers on board  — with actual babies in them! Previously, parents had to fold up their stroller and carry it in one arm while somehow carrying their baby and diaper bag in the other and not toppling over on a lurching bus. Skelly said new Muni buses’ designated parking spaces for strollers have been a boon on their adventures. “You can just say, ‘Excuse me, would you mind if I use that seat for the stroller?’” Skelly said, noting that he usually avoids riding the buses during commute time, and midday passengers are generally accommodating and friendly. The Skellys can surely finish #TotalMuni. Whether they can surmount an even more daunting task — raising Finn and any future siblings in San Francisco — is another question entirely. San Francisco famously has the  smallest percentage of residents younger than 18  — a mere 13.4 percent — of any major city in the country. Many families flee as soon as their first child approaches kindergarten age, but the Skellys said they would love to stay and enroll their kids in the city’s public schools. Housing, of course, is the big challenge . They’re paying $1,500 a month for their rent-controlled, one-bedroom apartment and couldn’t squeeze any more kids into it. Affording a larger apartment will be hard, and they’re planning to avoid it as long as possible. There are big pluses to raising kids in San Francisco, however. Already, my boys, 5 and 8, are more street savvy than I was when I moved to the city at age 22. Their public school is terrific. The parks, libraries, museums and endless cultural activities are wonderful, too. Plus, there are those only-in-San Francisco moments that just don’t happen in the suburbs. Like when Skelly took Finn, who’d spiked a fever and was very out of sorts, on the 38-Geary to reach Kaiser. They happened to sit across from a Catholic priest, who blessed Finn right there on the bus. “I tell you, every single person was just riveted. You know, most people on the bus are on their phone, but everyone was like, ‘What is going on?’” Skelly recalled. “What is the priest doing? He has his hand on the baby — is this the last rites?” They made it to Kaiser and were back home a couple of hours later, Finn’s fever gone and the baby back to his happy self. Skelly said he called his Irish Catholic grandmother to tell her the story. “I said, ‘Hey, I don’t know who to thank. Do I thank the doctor or do I thank the priest?’” Skelly said with a laugh. “She said, ‘Oh, you gotta thank the priest!’” Or the Muni bus itself. The real place for tragedies and small miracles — sometimes on the same day.WASHINGTON — When it comes to online conspiracy theories, Sen. Kamala Harris’ campaign follows the old mantra: Sunlight is the best disinfectant. Traditionally, political public relations teams avoid commenting on conspiracies, misinformation or base insinuations about their clients, believing that calling attention to them dignifies and thus elevates them from the fringes. But Harris’ communications team has been doing the opposite — immediately calling out material it sees as baseless. Veterans of Democratic presidential campaigns say other campaigns should take note, because the strategy reflects a new normal in politics. Former President Barack Obama and the Democrats’ 2016 presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, were plagued by false conspiracy theories, from questioning of Obama’s place of birth (Hawaii) to rumors of Clinton health problems. The internet and social media allow these types of theories to grow and fester, and both candidates were eventually forced to respond. There’s every indication the 2020 presidential field will face more such attacks, enhanced by a voracious political extremist media sphere and foreign propaganda efforts. Harris’ team has already begun confronting misinformation online, from the seedy to the silly. When conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl tweeted that Harris was ineligible to be president because her immigrant parents hadn’t lived in this country for five years before she was born, the California senator’s campaign communications director, Lily Adams, retweeted it and  called it out  as “garbage” within five minutes. Wohl’s assertion was fictitious: Harris is eligible to run for president as a U.S.-born citizen under the Constitution, and there are no natural-born citizenship requirements regarding parents’ status. This type of stuff was garbage in 2008 and it’s garbage now.  https://t.co/npUp1yHroq The campaign even wades in when the underlying controversy seems silly. During an interview with radio show “The Breakfast Club,” Harris  revealed that she had smoked marijuana  in college and talked about music she has listened to, including Snoop Dogg and Tupac. Some listeners blended the answers together, causing a mild internet storm when people pointed out that those artists weren’t performing when the 54-year-old Harris was in college. Sams  went on offense  to dispel the confusion, tweeting out video of the remarks and deriding Harris’ critics for “trying to make Reefergate happen.” He also jumped in when Harris made a barbecue pit stop in South Carolina and a conservative radio host  tweeted  a roundabout allegation that Harris was promoting climate change by eating beef — cattle production being a notorious emitter of methane gas. But Sams noted within minutes that in fact,  “It was pork.” The rightwing is so desperate to attack  @KamalaHarris  they\\'re trying to make Reefergate happen. @djenvy  asked what she listened to.  @cthagod  made a pot joke. Then she answered  @djenvy \\'s question. This really isn\\'t that complicated. Just watch.  pic.twitter.com/jIuRLFUULF It was pork.  https://t.co/GvGG3Lio0g The campaign declined to comment for this story, but political communications specialists who are not working with any current presidential candidates say the lean-in approach of the Harris communications shop is a model of what campaigns will need to do this election cycle. “I don’t think there’s any option to ignore anything anymore,” said Brian Fallon, who was Clinton’s presidential campaign press secretary and now runs the left-aligned advocacy group Demand Justice. “Any 2020 campaign’s press operation is wise to be constantly monitoring what gets picked up on Twitter, essentially, and to immediately speak to debunk and contain rather than wish it would go away.” In previous eras, campaigns could wait and see what the media ran with. With the internet, that cycle has been shortened from days to minutes. Most newsrooms monitor Twitter to see what gets traction, and some assign stories accordingly. Sometimes, what gets traction is Trump’s Twitter feed itself. It’s easy for Democratic campaigns to see the benefits of trying to grab hold of the narrative on social media — as Trump does nearly every day. To stay ahead of the news cycle, Fallon said, smart campaigns will capitalize on the same social media environment to control what’s being said about the candidate. A campaign’s silence or slowness to respond to circulating allegations could be interpreted as “panic mode,” he added. “Twitter, I think, has become something of an assignment editor in recent years,” Fallon said. “Only like 20 percent of the general public is on Twitter, but basically 100 percent of political reporters are on Twitter. ... So engaging immediately and confidently and providing new facts and context is a must.” The need for rapid response is made even more urgent by the revelations about Russia’s propaganda efforts during the 2016 election, which U.S. intelligence agencies concluded were designed to promote Trump’s candidacy. Those operations promoted conspiracy theories online to harm Trump’s rivals and sow political discord. The Department of Homeland Security has pledged that the administration will combat any such efforts in the 2020 campaign, amid concerns that Trump’s own diminishing of Russian election disruption would carry over into the administration’s work. Chris Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said in a recent call with reporters that his office would help “anybody who comes knocking on our door.” Even so, former Obama campaign press secretary Ben LaBolt agrees that ignoring conspiracy theories is no longer a luxury that campaigns can enjoy. He should know — false theories about Obama’s birthplace plagued the president for years. The persistent queries eventually forced him to release two copies of his birth certificate as he  lamented  the unfounded rumors as “silliness,” adding that “normally (he) would not comment on something like this.” The notion that responding to a conspiracy theory elevates it is also a thing of the past, LaBolt said. He noted that Trump still promotes conspiracy theories on Twitter and elsewhere without checking on their veracity, from  tweeting baselessly  about “rigged” Google search results to  falsely implying  that his 2016 opponent Sen. Ted Cruz’s father was involved in John F. Kennedy’s assassination. “We live in a world where you can’t even necessarily trust what’s coming out of the president of the United States’ mouth, and he’s not going to check his sources before he tweets something out,” LaBolt said. “Once things are in the ecosystem, they’re in an environment with no editors, and it’s the campaign’s responsibility to serve as those editors.” Given the president’s history of promoting such theories, effectively defusing them is in some ways a test of candidates’ abilities to stand up to Trump, said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist and former Clinton campaign spokesman. “Democrats want a (nominee) that can defeat Donald Trump, and one way to demonstrate that is aggressively taking on the type of conspiracies that he fosters, thrives on and promotes,” Ferguson said. “There’s no candidate who will succeed this cycle without confronting the right-wing conspiracy fever, and defeating fraudulent memes about them.”Ximena Rodriguez’s daughter wasn’t feeling well. She had a fever and was complaining of a sharp pain in her stomach. It’s appendicitis, the doctors told Rodriguez when she brought 9-year-old Isabella to the hospital in June. They’d take out her appendix, and she would be fine. Rodriguez could take her little girl home the next day. But after Isabella got home, her fever spiked again — 104 degrees. Back at the hospital, doctors ran tests for days. They eventually found that one of Isabella’s kidneys was failing, and an infection was raging out of control in her urinary tract. It took nearly two weeks to push back the infection with intravenous antibiotics. In October, Isabella fell ill again and needed 10 more days in the hospital. By the time she came home, she was feeling healthy and strong — but her mother had fallen desperately behind on their rent. Rodriguez is a self-employed bookkeeper. When she doesn’t work, she doesn’t get paid. For 23 days she hadn’t left Isabella’s side at the hospital, and for four weeks she’d had no income. “I’m a very hard worker,” said Rodriguez, 49, crying softly in the living room of her San Ramon apartment while Isabella played with a friend in her bedroom. “But I fell behind, and I couldn’t catch up.” For the first time in her life, she sought help. She reached out to Catholic Charities in Contra Costa County, and a caseworker connected her with The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing, which provides one-time funds to people in unexpected crises. The fund covered her November rent. Born and raised in Bolivia, Rodriguez got a bachelor’s degree in accounting from Bolivian Catholic University and made a good living at a petroleum company for more than a decade. When she lost that job in the late 1990s, she came to California on the advice of a sister who was already here. She’s been a single mother to Isabella plus a son, 20-year-old Nicolas, for almost all their lives. She’s had her own bookkeeping business for more than five years, working primarily with Spanish-speaking clients in the Bay Area and Central Valley. She’s never needed financial assistance before — not from the fathers of her children, not from her family, not from the government. Asking for help after Isabella was sick was a hard thing to do. “I’m so appreciative of how they did Season of Sharing for me,” Rodriguez said. “I don’t know what I would have done without it.” Rodriguez’s financial challenges started before her daughter became ill, when Rodriguez herself developed an inflammatory condition called myositis, which caused extreme fatigue and weakness. She was out of work for nearly six months in late 2015 and early 2016. How to Help For 32 years, The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing Fund has helped more than 150,000 Bay Area individuals and families facing unexpected life crises. Want to help?

But Rodriguez still had a sizable savings from her job in Bolivia with the petroleum company. She didn’t like tapping into that money to help cover rent and other bills — but that’s what the savings was for, after all. She’d always told her clients that they should have at least enough saved to cover two months of living expenses. By spring, 2016, Rodriguez was ready to go back to work. She was still ill, and the steroids she had to take to fight the inflammation had caused her to gain a lot of weight. But she needed to work. And for a while, life seemed to settle down again. Her son went off to college at UCLA, and she was so proud of him and of herself for seeing him to this accomplishment. Isabella kept getting mysterious infections requiring regular trips to the doctor, but she was otherwise healthy and happy. Then the appendicitis hit. And Rodriguez, after so long being sick herself, no longer had any savings to back her up. “I was never rich, but I wasn’t poor. I had everything I needed. I could pay for this apartment, pay for the car, help my children, pay for my son in college,” Rodriguez said. “But all my savings, everything, it’s gone away. I never imagined that would happen.” Her caseworker, Dora Segura, said Rodriguez immediately struck her as bright and hardworking. She had a successful business on top of raising two kids on her own, in a country where she spoke almost none of the language when she first settled down. “She’s always done everything on her own. And she’s really proud to be on her own and to do what she can to provide for the family,” Segura said. “There are just times when people don’t have the cushion they need.” Rodriguez has been steadily back at her job since Nov. 5. She isn’t working as much as she’d like, though, because she still needs to get IV infusions for the myositis once a month and Isabella has checkups every two weeks. All those appointments add up to hours she isn’t paid. So she worries about how they’ll pay their next bills. But she’s made it this far on confidence, assertiveness and faith — she says she’ll just have to keep forging on. It’s what she has to do for her children and their future. “She is one of the most perseverant people I know,” said her son, Nicolas. “Sometimes circumstances are pretty bad, and it seems like there’s no hope. But my mom, once she starts thinking about how to solve a problem, she’ll find any route and come to a solution, always.” Last summer, when Isabella was so sick, Nicolas insisted he wanted to come home and help. He could stay with Isabella while Rodriguez worked. Or he could get a job and contribute to their finances. But Rodriguez wouldn’t hear it. “I don’t want to block his education. I don’t want to be selfish,” she said. “I always tell my son, ‘You are my American dream.’ I want to take care of my daughter. And I want my son to finish college. Those are my goals.”Upcoming political events in the Bay Area.

Mayor London Breed confirmed Friday night that Adachi had died, saying that San Francisco had “lost a dedicated public servant.” He was the only elected public defender in California. The exact circumstances and cause of Adachi’s death were not immediately known, but sources said he died of a heart attack. “As one of the few elected public defenders in our country, Jeff always stood up for those who didn’t have a voice, have been ignored and overlooked, and who needed a real champion,” Breed said in a statement. “He was committed not only to the fight for justice in the courtroom, but he was also a relentless advocate for criminal justice reform. “Jeff led the way on progressive policy reforms, including reducing recidivism, ending cash bail, and standing up for undocumented and unrepresented children.” Adachi’s colleagues were in shock and mourning the city’s loss. Deputy Public Defender Eric Quandt called his boss “a true visionary for equal rights and criminal justice.” “I’ve never seen a defense lawyer more tenacious or courageous,” Quandt said. “He made the San Francisco Public Defender’s Office one of the premier law firms in the nation. I’m so proud to have had the opportunity to work under his guidance. I’m devastated. I’m sure I’m speaking for many of my colleagues.” He is remembered as being a firebrand — an intense and tenacious man who delved deeply into the subjects he cared about, regardless of what anyone else thought. From a young age, he enjoyed solitary pursuits, like writing and reading, he  told The Chronicle in 2010 . He went on to study business at Sacramento City College before transferring to UC Berkeley. He graduated from UC Hastings College of the Law in 1985. A year later, the Public Defender’s Office hired him. Adachi had been sworn in for another term as a public defender in January after running unopposed. Unlike other city department heads who focus on management, Adachi would regularly step up and defend clients himself. In December,  he won an acquittal for Carlos Argueta,  an immigrant rights attorney who faced a murder charge. “I am deeply saddened by the unexpected news today,” said city District Attorney George Gascón. “Jeff was a passionate and relentless advocate who always fought hard for what he believed in. He represented the underserved and gave his career to public service.” State Sen. Scott Wiener remembered Adachi as a man of his word, one who “fought like a dog for what he believed in for his clients.” “I always knew that everything he said or did came from the heart,” Wiener said. “He was someone who, it didn’t matter to him what people thought about him or if people were mad at him. He was there to fight for the most marginalized people in society.” Adachi’s passion for social justice extended outside of City Hall, too,  to documentary filmmaking . His films, “You Don’t Know Jack: The Jack Soo Story” (2009) and “The Slanted Screen” (2006), examined the challenges Asian American actors faced in Hollywood. “Defender” (2017), co-directed by Jim Choi, used a case Adachi defended to examine racial inequities in the criminal justice system. Each of the films were shown in film festivals. Former Supervisor Bevan Dufty, who now serves on the BART Board of Directors, knew Adachi for more than 20 years and remembered him as a ferocious advocate. He was well known at City Hall for fighting for more money for his budget. “He really tried to see the big picture in promoting services and approaches to reducing recidivism,” Dufty said. “I really felt like (Adachi) had a vision that was needed to reduce the involvement of poor people in the justice system. I didn’t always agree with him, but I always appreciated that he made this job so much bigger than what the charter called for. He had a great sense of humor.” Every year, Adachi’s office wore T-shirts in San Francisco’s Gay Pride Parade that read, ‘Getting People Off Since 1921.” Adachi also published an annual calendar featuring pictures of his lawyers. “He wasn’t somebody who tried to stay under the radar,” Dufty said. “He was proud of the work he did, he cared deeply about his clients, and he was an important part of the reform movement in our justice system.” Supervisor Hillary Ronen said she was devastated by the loss. “He made so many of us feel safe,” she said. “For people of color, they knew that no matter how bad things got, they had the fiercest advocate who would always stand by their side. He was one of a kind.” Ronen’s husband, Francisco Ugarte,  worked in Adachi’s office representing undocumented immigrants. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-San Mateo, whose district includes part of San Francisco, called Adachi “the real deal ... a righteous public servant who believed passionately in the Constitution, due process and the rights of the accused to be ably represented by counsel. He did not shrink from public debate or tough political decisions.” “The last time I saw him he was at a political event decked out in a beautiful jacket for Halloween, and it was 8 a.m. in the morning,” she said in a statement. “My prayers go out to his family at this painful and numbing time. The community of San Francisco will envelop you and give you strength. God bless you.” Adachi took great pride in being an elected public defender, saying it gave him an independence he wouldn’t have if he was appointed by someone. “Letting voters elect a public defender has dramatic, real-world advantages,” he wrote in a March 2018 letter to the Los Angeles Times to take issue with an editorial in that paper saying electing public defenders was not necessary. “Because I’m elected, I’ve been able to publicly advocate for proper funding — even refusing cases — without fear of being fired by the mayor or board of supervisors,” he wrote. “We’ve been able to hire social workers for families and immigration specialists to fight deportation and re-entry staff to bring down recidivism. That’s something that benefits all San Franciscans, not just those charged with crimes.”Melissa Geissinger measured grief by the number of cars she could see in a driveway or a hotel parking lot. They were a sign of loss. More vehicles meant more heartache. In the weeks after the Tubbs Fire, thousands of people displaced by the North Bay fires fled to temporary housing in far-flung corners of Sonoma County. They couldn’t go home, so their cars clotted the neighborhoods of their friends or were parked all day outside the Finley Community Center in Santa Rosa — one of 43 evacuation centers that opened in the county during the fire that broke out late Oct. 8. The driveway at the Sebastopol home of Melissa’s parents,  Nancy and Ron Crain, was gridlocked. Melissa and her husband, Cole, had been staying there since a desperate escape from their Coffey Park home the night of the fire. So were 15 of their acquaintances — it was so crowded that Melissa began calling it “the Crain Compound.” The Geissingers played board games and watched the local news, one fire montage after another. The passing days were a juxtaposition of joy and despair — the world around them was still burning, but at least they were together. Why? Why did this happen?  There were no good answers. A few days after the Tubbs Fire, Cole and Melissa Geissinger wear gas masks to protect themselves from the smoke as the wildfires continue to burn. They evacuated to Melissa’s parents’ home in Sebastopol. Melissa wanted her life to be normal again, even though she knew it wouldn’t be for a long time. She was on a terrible vacation, and she wished it would end so she could return home. But she didn’t know if their home even existed. Melissa was pregnant, and with the smoke and fumes from incinerated households filling the air, going into the fire zone didn’t seem like a good idea. “The ones unaffected, or minimally so, get back to their lives and try to push the badness out of their minds,” she said. “But some of us don’t have that luxury, and it sort of feels like we’re left behind. You start to get ignored or glossed over to a point. It’s uncomfortable.” As Melissa struggled not to come undone, Cole rationalized their loss, minimizing his grief until it weighed less. He was the more analytical one, studying historical fire maps and looking up statistics. He assumed the house on Astaire Court was gone, so he began writing a list of everything they had owned, down to spatulas and stationery, for the insurance company. Cole Geissinger (left) and friend Valerie Soldate search through the rubble of Cole’s home in the Coffey Park neighborhood of Santa Rosa for anything he can salvage. In late October, residents were finally let back in to sift through what was left after the Tubbs Fire. They both felt guilty. There were people enduring greater hardships. Some fire survivors were living out of suitcases in hotels and applying for space in trailers supplied by the federal government. Others were grieving loved ones who hadn’t escaped the flames. “You’re so strong,” their friends said. “You’ll find a new normal.” Melissa didn’t feel strong. She was lost and wanted her old normal. She and Cole play-acted at normalcy. It was late October, and they visited a pumpkin patch with their dogs, Twyla and Barnaby, and carved jack-o’-lanterns. But they didn’t have front steps to place them on, and that reduced Melissa to tears. Little things kept making her cry. They went shopping. Neither had spare shoes or underwear — when they drove away from Coffey Park on that chaotic night, they hadn’t grabbed any. But the aisles at the local department stores were stripped bare. Unaccustomed to accepting help, they finally acquiesced to  an online fundraiser  and donations. Melissa wore maternity clothing from a high school classmate she hadn’t seen in years. Soon it was her 34th birthday, and everyone gathered around the kitchen table for a spaghetti dinner. She didn’t feel like celebrating. Depression was creeping in, warping the edges of her new reality. On her chocolate birthday cake, there were no candles. Melissa didn’t want to see any flames. Astrid Granger and her husband, Henry, moved into a basement flat in Oakland with their daughter and her new husband after losing their home in the Tubbs Fire.  Henry and Astrid Granger weren’t city people, but here they were, living in the city with their daughter. Audrey and her new husband rented the basement unit of an old house in Oakland. It had low ceilings and water pipes protruding from odd corners. They hissed every time the toilet flushed. But the unit’s length was the same as the Grangers’ home on Jenna Place, which somehow comforted Astrid. It was mid-November, and they still couldn’t decipher the city’s street-sweeping schedule. They kept finding $66 citations on their windshield. They were too old for this. They were too old to start over, really. Why? Why did this happen?  There were no good answers. Astrid felt guilty for imposing on Audrey. Their daughter was 38 years old and had married the previous year. Now Astrid and Henry were sleeping in her bed while the newlyweds settled on separate couches in the living room. They stacked their pillows and Temper-Pedic foam in the corner before work every morning. “It’s so hard,” said Audrey. “You don’t want to see your parents going through anything like this in their older years. They had it made.” Astrid stored her makeup in a shoe box and hung her clothing on temporary racks. It was a new wardrobe, and the price tags were still attached — she hadn’t worn most of it yet. Strands of her hair, long and blond, were falling out. Too much stress. Henry had recently fallen into a diabetic coma. His insulin and medications burned with their home, and with so much else going on, he hadn’t immediately refilled the prescriptions. Then, one evening, he swallowed a double dose of the wrong medicine. Astrid found him in bed unresponsive. His skin was cold and clammy. She called 911. Paramedics rushed him to Highland Hospital. More stress. He was better now, and he had lost weight, too. Astrid liked that, actually, and was happy to tell him so. She was plucky and bold, unafraid to share her opinions. Astrid Granger recovers an item from her Coffey Park home after the fire. She had already decided they weren’t rebuilding their home. They probably wouldn’t live to see it completed. How long would it take, anyway? One year? Five? She wasn’t sure. She would rather remember Jenna Place the way it had been. The past was familiar, and she reminisced often, scrolling through photos on her iPad. In her dreams, she walked down its hallways, touching the framed photos and ceramic tiles. She recalled moving in. The concrete in the house wasn’t dry yet, so she and Henry stored their furniture in a home around the block and checked into the Sandman Hotel. There were no trees, no fences, no landscaping on their Coffey Park street. It took years for the Grangers to add those amenities, because she was young and they were broke. Sometimes Astrid worked as a house cleaner to bring in extra money. Among the first things she bought were six small trees from the Kmart on Cleveland Avenue. Her favorite was a redwood tree that she planted in her backyard. It was all destroyed by the fire. The house, the tree, the Kmart. “So there, no use crying about it,” Astrid said. “What can we do now?” Decorative plates that survived the fire are displayed in the basement flat in Oakland where Henry and Astrid Granger stayed after the lost their home.  The doorbell trilled, breaking the momentary quiet of the Crain Compound. “This kid already has more clothes than I do,” Melissa said, welcoming a friend to her baby shower. She handed the gift to her mother and guided the guest into the living room. It was mid-November and the Crains’ house looked like outer space. Stars and rocket ships hung from the ceiling, and twinkle lights draped the windows. Presents were stacked near the front door. “What we have been through this past month has been kind of crazy,” Melissa told her friends. “I don’t know how we are getting through it. It’s one step at a time. Having a village makes it not seem so impossible.” “We love you guys,” a friend shouted. Melissa Geissinger and husband, Cole, open gifts during their baby shower in Sebastopol in November. The party had been scheduled for a couple of weeks earlier, but that was before the Tubbs Fire. Before — she was stuck on that word. Before, they had a 1,400-square-foot home filled with the belongings that make up a life: a fridge with special produce drawers, musical instruments, photo books. She and Cole had mapped the locations of everything important in their home, determined to exhume something from the ashes. They had finally returned 11 days after evacuating, after the search teams, the cadaver dogs and the utility crews had finished their work and the National Guard reopened the neighborhood. All that was left was a gas line and a charred bathtub. Her books had carbonized, the pages crumbling with a touch. The branding iron shaped into their initials from the wedding was soft and warped, covered in a sheen of melted glass. They placed the few recognizable items on a tarp in the driveway, and Melissa cried in her air mask. The Geissingers’ ornaments are seen in the rubble of their home in the Coffey Park neighborhood after the fire. Now, all their possessions fit on a bed. Before. Suddenly, she yanked herself back to the present. Melissa pulled scraps of paper from a gift bag, reading aloud name suggestions for “Squiggy,” the baby that was due in less than a month. She unwrapped pastel blankets and cooed at impossibly small onesies. She gave more hugs and assured more people that she was fine, really, everything would be OK. She almost convinced herself. Hours later, the house emptied. She was alone, surrounded by crumpled wrapping paper and tufts of colorful tissue. The drive through Santa Rosa was devoid of Astrid’s familiar landmarks. The Tubbs Fire had leveled most of them. There, Astrid said, pointing. That was once the DeTurk Round Barn. And there, the Hilton Hotel. The beautiful hills east of Highway 101, devastated. It hurt to see. She often drove to the North Bay: to grocery shop, buy shoes and attend religious services in Windsor. She could do those things in Oakland, but she knew Sonoma County’s freeways and residential streets by heart. Besides, years ago, she had refused to learn how to parallel park. In Santa Rosa, there were parking lots. And Santa Rosa was where her friends lived. She was already far away — nearly two hours with traffic — and she didn’t want to completely cleave from the rhythms of her old life. She and Henry would move back soon. They couldn’t stay in Oakland much longer. They were grateful — they really were. But living in Audrey’s flat wasn’t right. They felt powerless. Parents should take care of their children, not the other way around. It was almost Thanksgiving, and very little had changed. It was purgatory. “It’s kind of tight in here,” Henry said. “One bathroom, four people. You can imagine how that works out. We just manage to tolerate one another and try not to get on each other’s nerves.” An insurance agent working in Texas was assessing the Grangers’ property. There weren’t enough agents in the North Bay to canvass the disaster zone. He had an out-of-town area code, so they could always tell when it was him calling. Hopefully the policy money would come through. They still had $50,000 to pay on the mortgage of their decimated home. In the meantime, they completed mind-numbing forms to replace documents like their passports and Henry’s birth certificate from Alabama. “Yes, we are really the Grangers,” those phone calls went. “No, we can’t really prove it.” They searched for apartments but never jumped fast enough. By the time they got to Santa Rosa, the place was usually packed with other fire survivors who also desperately needed a home. “We are older,” Henry told their real estate agent. “We live in Oakland. We can’t compete with these other people. We are at a disadvantage. Can you please set us up with something that is just for us?” Finally, at the end of November, Henry’s cell phone rang. Astrid Granger cooks breakfast in the Santa Rosa town house she and her husband rented after the Tubbs Fire destroyed their home. A landlord had accepted their application for a town house off Dutton Avenue. Three bedrooms, 2½ bathrooms. Furnished, minus the coffee maker and microwave oven. They could move in the next morning. Their neighbors would be other fire survivors. “It’s very sobering to have to move into a new town house,” Astrid said as Henry hung up the phone. “Right? You pride yourself on being a homeowner. We aren’t in that category anymore. But I like that it’s mostly other victims.” “Yeah, the manager of this deal, the lady, she was a fire victim herself,” Henry said. “She had a hair-raising story of getting her kids out.” “We lucked out,” Astrid said. Cole and Melissa Geissinger announce the baby news with a photo taken in the backyard of their Coffey Park home in June 2017. Melissa was seven months pregnant in October when the Tubbs Fire destroyed their home. Melissa and Cole wheeled their suitcases across the lobby of UCSF Betty Irene Moore Women’s Hospital, stopping at the information desk to check in. The receptionist handed them stickers printed with their names. “‘Guardian.’ That’s scary,” Cole said, pointing to the name tag that marked him as a soon-to-be parent. “This poor child, stuck with us,” Melissa said, laughing. It was late December, and a lighted menorah was propped on the desk. Nearby, a pine tree glittered with ornaments and twinkle lights. At 38 weeks, Melissa was having labor induced. They wouldn’t be bringing the baby home, at least not to their own home. They planned to stay in Sebastopol until they decided on their next move. Maybe they would install a manufactured home in her parents’ backyard. The only catch: Sonoma County rules stipulated that second units couldn’t exceed 1,000 square feet. Not ideal. That next step seemed overwhelming. But as they settled into their hospital room and Melissa’s contractions increased, they felt excited for the first time in a long time — a baby! Their baby! More than 17 hours later, he arrived. Ollie Geissinger on Dec. 22, 2017, a couple of days after his birth. The baby was 5 pounds and 8 ounces, and Melissa felt a love she had never known. The doctor placed him on her chest, whole and warm, flush against her skin. Cole cut the umbilical cord. “Oh my God, he’s a real person,” she said. “He’s right here.” Motherhood had never felt natural to Melissa. When she became pregnant the first time, two years before, she wasn’t excited, and that scared her. Then, at six weeks, she miscarried. The grief was more tangible than she could have expected. It felt like her fault. But now she and Cole have a son. He made everything else seem smaller. Maybe she’d been wrong, Melissa admitted. She would be a good mother. They named him Apollo, after the Greek god of music and light, an immortal known for his strength. And Ollie, as they nicknamed him, would need strength. Ten days after he was born, doctors rushed him into open-heart surgery. One year ago, more than a dozen fires shot to life in the North Bay. One of them, the Tubbs Fire, would become the most destructive wildfire in California history, killing 24 people and incinerating entire neighborhoods in and around Santa Rosa. One of those was Coffey Park. Henry and Astrid Granger, who had lived there for 30 years, and Melissa and Cole Geissinger, residents for just two years, survived the fire but lost all they had. In the year since the fire, The Chronicle’s Lizzie Johnson has spent hundreds of hours with the couples to report this story, witnessing some of the most intimate, heartbreaking and joyous moments as they rebuilt their lives.

Email:  ljohnson@sfchronicle.com  Twitter:  @LizzieJohnsonnn As terror of Tubbs Fire fades, survivors face new challengesTyler Roberson had it all planned — at least the next 12 years, which is a lot at age 23. First, she was going to pass biology, the last class standing between her and her high school diploma. Next, she would enroll at the community college down the street from her apartment. After that, she would transfer to a four-year university and major in psychology. Finally, she would start a career as a counselor. She was planning on doing each of those steps while raising two young children and working two jobs. Roberson wanted to get it all done in eight years but gave herself up to 12. Then, in October, her plans hit a snag. She was working as an overnight custodian for UC Berkeley, cleaning the Cal football lounge and sports offices. She knew the job was temporary, since she was filling in for another employee. But she said she was told that if she stuck with it, the job could become a permanent position after six months. Roberson had a second job, but the work wasn’t steady. She enjoyed the custodial work, even though the shift was 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. The area she cleaned felt safe, unlike the main campus where “everything is really old and creaky and creepy,” she said. And while her supervisors were picky — a fingerprint left on a window, for instance, was a no-no — the job paid well. Before the UC Berkeley job, Roberson had worked at Tesla in Fremont, 12 hours a day, six days a week. To make it there by 6 a.m., she had to catch the first BART train around 4 a.m. She wouldn’t get home until 8 p.m. most days. “They kept saying that the schedule would change, but it didn’t,” she said. “The checks were great, but I had to be away from the kids so much. Including travel time, it was just too much.” At UC Berkeley, Roberson said, she held out hope that the custodial work would become permanent. But four months in, the employee whom she was filling in for returned from leave, and Roberson was no longer needed. She got one-week notice. The employers at her other job, as an in-home care professional helping the elderly, didn’t have work for her either. Money was tight. Raising a 1-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son isn’t cheap, even with all three of them sharing the modest one-bedroom apartment in Antioch and relying on public transportation. “I just got really nervous,” Roberson said. “My nerves just got really bad.” Through a family friend, Roberson eventually found a new job, but several weeks without a paycheck had put her a month behind on rent. Her landlord sent her a three-day notice to pay or vacate the premises. Roberson tried to stay positive during the ordeal. She didn’t want her children, Bella and Isaiah, to know how close they came to losing their home. Roberson wanted them to focus on kid things — building a gingerbread house, learning to read and playing with their new guinea pig, Roger. “I was just thinking, ‘I can’t lose my place, I just can’t,’” Roberson said. She said she Googled something like “Help in Contra Costa County,” which led her to The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing Fund. The nonprofit provides one-time funds to people in crises like Roberson. Kamico Hayle, of Contra Costa County’s Employment and Human Services Department, who helped Roberson with the application for Season of Sharing help, said Roberson’s initiative impressed him. “She was going above and beyond, acquiring new employment soon after being laid off,” Hayle said. “She exhausted all other resources, so I’m glad this program was available to her.” Roberson is now working as a customer service representative for East Bay Paratransit, the service for people with disabilities who cannot use regular buses or trains. But the money from Season of Sharing helped Roberson catch up on rent payments. Her 12-year plan is now back on track. One benefit of her new job, Roberson said, is that she can pop open her biology textbook when there are no calls to field. Paying the rent “was a big weight lifted off my shoulders,” she said. “I felt like I could move on and continue. “If I keep going, I feel like everything will always just fall back into place, as long as I keep going. I feel like if I stop, everything I’ve worked for — not just this one thing, but everything I’ve been working toward — will fall apart and I’ll have to start all the way over again.”Typically when young people visit their senator’s office, they go home with a bunch of grip-and-grin photos showing them shaking hands with the lawmaker. But when an environmental activist group brought several children to Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s San Francisco office Friday to lobby her to back the Green New Deal, what they got was more of a finger-wagging than a handshake. The group,  the Sunrise Movement,  posted a video that promptly went viral of Bay Area kids ages 7 to 16 quarreling with the 85-year-old Democrat, who was just elected to her fifth full term. The Sunrise Movement wants lawmakers to pass  the Green New Deal,  a nonbinding proposal backed by first-term Democratic Rep.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  of New York and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., that calls for the U.S. to run on 100 percent renewable energy within 10 years. This is how  @SenFeinstein  reacted to children asking her to support the  #GreenNewDeal  resolution -- with smugness + disrespect. This is a fight for our generation\\'s survival. Her reaction is why young people desperately want new leadership in Congress.  pic.twitter.com/0zAkaxruMI The proposal is popular with left-leaning Democrats. But there are plenty of other ideas attached to the resolution, including a guarantee of universal health coverage and government support for making college affordable for all. It contains no cost estimates or funding sources. Republicans have denounced it as socialism on the march and centrists, including Feinstein, are dubious. In their get-together Friday, Feinstein told the group of young people that the proposal had no hope of passing the Republican-controlled Senate, and explained that she had a version that might stand a chance. In the two-minute, 19-second video posted by Sunrise, an edited version of a roughly 14-minute exchange, one of the children tells Feinstein, “Some scientists have said that we have 12 years to turn this (the effects of climate change) around.” “Well, it’s not going to get turned around in 10 years,” Feinstein replies. One of the children says, “The government is supposed to be for the people, by the people.” “You know what’s interesting about this group?” Feinstein replies. “I’ve been doing this for 30 years. I know what I’m doing. You come in here and it has to be my way or the highway. I don’t respond to that. I’ve gotten elected. I just ran. I was elected by almost a million-vote plurality. I know what I’m doing. So maybe people should listen a little bit.” “I hear what you saying, but we’re the people who voted for you,” a teenager says to Feinstein. “You’re supposed to listen to us.” “How old are you?” Feinstein asks. “I’m 16, I can’t vote,” the girl replies. “Well, you didn’t vote for me,” Feinstein says. An adult with the group tells the senator that any climate change proposal that doesn’t “take bold, transformative action is not going to be what we need.” “Well, you know better than I do,” Feinstein says. “So I think one day you should run for the Senate. And then you do it your way. “But in the meantime,” Feinstein adds, “I just won a big election.” The edited Sunrise version ends shortly thereafter. The full video shows that the atmosphere became less tense after the meeting broke up and Feinstein walked with some of the youths in her office, explaining her position. At one point one of the teenagers asked about an internship, and Feinstein appeared to tell her staff to arrange it. Sunrise spokesman Stephen O’Hanlon said Feinstein’s opposition “shows why we need fundamental change in the Democratic Party. Leaders like Feinstein are out of touch with the center of energy in the party, which is with the grassroots movement for a Green New Deal.” Feinstein issued a statement saying, “I want the children to know they were heard loud and clear. I have been and remain committed to doing everything I can to enact real, meaningful climate change legislation. “We had a spirited discussion and I presented the group with my draft resolution that provides specific responses to the climate change crisis, which I plan to introduce soon.” The youths may not have gone home with a photo of Feinstein, but they got a bigger souvenir in the digital age: The video of their encounter was viewed 1.4 million times within its first few hours online.Having Jon Gruden slap Raiders stickers on his North team helmet at last month’s Senior Bowl hit especially close to home for Keelan Doss, the receiver from UC Davis and Alameda High School. “Growing up in Alameda, man, I could see the Raiders’ stadium from my house,” Doss said before the game in Mobile, Ala.. “I actually remember the ‘Tuck’ game. It was not a good memory.” He returned home with more pleasant ones. After working with the Raiders’ coaching staff during the week leading up to the game, Doss had four receptions for 55 yards in the North’s 34-24 win over the South team coached by the 49ers’ staff. It was a positive step on the road to April’s NFL draft for Doss, who will attend next week’s scouting combine in Indianapolis and has been projected as a potential second- or third-day pick following his prolific college career with the Aggies. As a junior in 2017, Doss led all Division I players — FBS or FCS — with an average of 136.3 receiving yards per game, while amassing 115 catches for 1,499 yards. In his senior season, he helped lead the Aggies to a 10-3 record and an FCS playoff berth and left holding program records for career receptions (321), receiving yards (4,069) and 100-yard receiving games (19).

At one point late last year, ESPN draft guru Mel Kiper Jr. listed Doss among his top 10 draft prospects at the position. Yet coming out of high school, Doss generated little interest from Division I schools. So little, in fact, that one of his coaches, Brandon Younger, took to campaigning on his behalf. “We literally emailed over 50 schools with his film, his grades,” said Younger, now a coach for Foothill College in Los Altos Hills. “And he just wasn’t picking up any traction at all. It was really baffling.” Doss missed playing time at Alameda because of injuries, was tall but still lanky and dealt with a fire during his senior year that gutted the apartment where he and his mother lived. Ultimately, he said, his college options came down to UC Davis, Idaho and Sacramento State. “I honestly felt like my talent and ability would translate anywhere,” Doss said. “I didn’t really care where I went, I’d just go out and prove to everybody that I belong at the Power-5 level.” Academics at UC Davis appealed to Doss, as did then-head coach Ron Gould. Now the running backs coach at Stanford, Gould recalled Doss being up-front when they met. “He was very, very clear at the beginning that: ‘Hey, coach, my goal is to play in the NFL,’” Gould said. “And, ‘Can I make it to the NFL from Davis?’” Gould assured him that was a possibility. “He had the drive, the competitiveness, the passion to want to be great,” Gould said. “What you saw on film — him going up and snatching balls away from guys, running away from players, competing at every turn — you turn the film on and this young man is always going after it.” Doss still needed to get stronger and improve his route-running. Gould credited Doss with doing the latter in his first two seasons at Davis by putting in hours outside of practice. “He was the one guy over the summer that if you said, I’m going to take a guess that somebody is going to be working extra, it was him,” Gould said. The Aggies changed coaches after Doss’ sophomore season, when he averaged 13.8 yards per catch, replacing Gould with Dan Hawkins. Younger, the Alameda High coach, recalled that around that time FBS schools expressed interest in Doss as a transfer. The two discussed the possibility by phone, Younger said, with Doss opting to stay put. “I thought that was a really tough decision for a guy who could be playing on a bigger stage,” Younger said. “But ultimately it goes to show what kind of kid he is and how loyal he was to that program.” Doss opted to return to Davis for his senior season and to finish his degree in sociology. The Aggies won a share of the Big Sky Conference title for the first time in 2018 as Doss recorded 118 catches for 1,334 yards and nine touchdowns. At the Senior Bowl, Doss was one of six FCS players on the North roster. But he shrugged at a question about having to make a bigger jump to the NFL coming from a smaller school. “I don’t really see it like that, I’ll be honest with you,” Doss said. “We played a good hand of Power-5 schools (at Davis), obviously played a lot of FCS schools. And some of the best guys I’ve been against are from the FCS. Now, I take nothing away obviously from guys from the FBS. But the main difference in my opinion is just their size — they’re usually bigger — and there’s just more of them.” After Doss’ week in Mobile, Younger said he texted him: “Dude, you’ve been killing it.” Younger said Doss’ reply was something like: “Yeah, I’ve got to stay focused.” And as for the impending draft, Doss said: “I don’t stress about it too much.” “I just try to give teams a good reason to choose me through the body of work I put in through this draft process,” Doss said. “Once draft day comes, I’m just going to lay my head at night and live with myself. There’s nothing I can do about it.”A missed call spoiled a night to remember for Joe Thornton. Defenseman Charlie McAvoy scored 3:59 into overtime after the Bruins tied the game late on a controversial goal as Boston beat the Sharks 6-5 on a night Thornton collected his first hat trick in nearly nine years. McAvoy scored his fourth goal from the slot on an odd-man break to give the Bruins their sixth straight win. San Jose  sits a point behind Calgary for first in the Pacific Division. “We’re definitely disappointed we didn’t get the win,” Sharks captain Joe Pavelski said. “We had our chances.” Thornton scored his 13th goal of the season to break a 4-4 tie at 13:32 of the third period. That invited a cascade of hats to hit the ice from the sellout crowd at SAP Center. Thornton’s shot came from the high slot against the team that drafted him No. 1 in 1997 and traded him to the Sharks on Nov. 30, 2005. Thornton’s last three-goal game came  Oct. 27, 2010, against New Jersey and  goalie Martin Brodeur. “Yeah, I can believe it,” Thornton joked when asked if he could believe it had been that long. “I don’t shoot too often, but it was a good feeling.” Boston’s Chris Wagner tied it with his eighth goal at 18:11, a goal that stood despite Wagner appearing  to knock the puck over the goal line after using a high stick to knock it down. The Sharks argued long and hard to no avail. “It was above his shoulders,” Sharks head coach Peter DeBoer said. “The officiating in the whole third period … I’m sure we’ll get an explanation or some type of apology. It doesn’t help us in the standings, but that’s usually how it works.” “It was a tough one for all of them to miss,” Sharks forward Logan Couture added. “The refs are going to watch it and probably feel bad about this one.” Evander Kane was denied a chance to win in sudden death, too, when his breakaway was blown dead once officials realized the Boston goal was off its moorings. The Sharks overcame 3-0 and 4-2 deficits to tie the game in dramatic fashion 24 seconds before the second intermission. Couture converted a penalty shot while San Jose was killing a penalty by filling Boston goalie Tuukka Rask’s five-hole with his 22nd goal of the season and second in two games for a 4-4 tie. Trailing by two, Thornton scored his second of the game with a close-in put back after Marcus Sorensen deflected Radim Simek’s point shot at 16:03. Those two late-period goals followed what appeared to be a back-breaking Boston power-play strike at 6:30. San Jose did a terrific job denying the Bruins entry on the power play until Danton Heinen sprang a breaking Jake DeBrusk, who beat Sharks goalie Martin Jones for his 18th goal and a 4-2 lead. Boston was all over the Sharks at the outset, scoring three times in less than five minutes late in the opening period. Torey Krug scored his sixth at 13:49, defenseman Zdeno Chara picked up his fourth off a faceoff win at 16:26 and Karson Kuhlman scored his first at 18:24 by capping a 2-on-1. San Jose got an important goal late when Thornton was again in the right place at the right time to knock in a loose puck at 19:57 after Pavelski attempted a wraparound.The game plan Friday against top-seeded Mitty wasn’t  complicated, said Sacred Heart Cathedral boys basketball coach  Sean MacKay . Control the glass. Get out in transition. Run their three-point shooters off the arc. Exploit mismatches. But when you’ve won just 10  of 24 games, finished  seventh in the eight-team West Catholic Athletic League and have won only three times since Dec. 29 — twice over last-place Valley Christian — clearly MacKay dealt a louder message before and during his team’s eye-opening 69-65 Central Coast Section Open Division first-round upset win at Piedmont Hills-San Jose. Not really, he said. More so, it was a belief he  instilled throughout all the losing. “When no one else believes in them, I always do,” he said. There’s a lot to like, especially the senior leadership of 6-foot point guard  Cedric Reed  Jr.  (13.2 scoring average),  Elijah Flowers  (8.7 points, 7.5 rebounds) and  Osin McCormack  (10.4 points, 10 rebounds per game). Junior  Oscar Cheng , a 6-8 power forward, is averaging 9.7 points and 8.2 rebounds. There are lots of contributors, including junior guard  Kori McCoy  (7.9 ppg) and freshman  Ray John Jackson , who contributed a couple of key free throws  against Mitty. “It’s a great group of kids who have dealt with a lot of adversity,” MacKay said.

On Thursday, the team hired former Jets offensive coordinator John Morton as a senior offensive assistant. The Raiders also hired longtime running backs coach Kirby Wilson to replace Jemal Singleton, who recently left for the same role with the Bengals. Morton was the Jets’ offensive coordinator in 2017 after coaching wide receivers for the Saints (2015-16) and 49ers (2011-14). Morton previously held the title of senior offensive assistant in Oakland from 2002 through ’03, and was an offensive assistant and wide receivers coach in Jon Gruden’s first stint as the Raiders’ head coach. Wilson has coached running backs for 21 seasons in the NFL, including last season with Arizona. He also previously worked with Gruden as the running backs coach at Tampa Bay from 2002 through ’03. Taver Johnson, meanwhile, joins the Raiders’ staff as assistant defensive backs coach. Johnson has coached mostly at the collegiate level, including as the cornerbacks coach at Ohio State last season and defensive coordinator at Temple in 2017. Johnson figures to take on some responsibilities of Derrick Ansley, who left after one season as the Raiders’ defensive backs coach to join the staff at the University of Tennessee. The Raiders also  announced the hires of  Brentson Buckner as their  defensive line coach  — replacing Mike Trgovac, who is now a senior assistant — and  A.J. Neibel as their head of strength and conditioning . Former strength and conditioning coordinator Tom Shaw was fired in December during his first season with the team. Shaw’s staff included Kelsey Martinez, the first female assistant coach in Raiders franchise history and the only female strength and conditioning coach in the league last season. As of Thursday, Martinez was no longer listed as a coach on the Raiders’ website. A team spokesman did not return a request for comment.Besides trying to continue the momentum of its hot streak, Stanford has another big source of motivation when it visits Arizona State on Wednesday night. A win would give the Cardinal a sweep of the Sun Devils, an important asset, given that head-to-head results are the first tiebreaker  for one of the top four spots in the Pac-12 tournament. The first four teams get opening-round byes, which moves them a step closer to winning the title and gaining the automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. In a season when the conference has not been rocking the critical NET rankings — only 31st-ranked Washington was in the top 67 as of Tuesday morning — any team that doesn’t win the Pac-12 title has to start thinking about the NIT or one of the lesser postseason events. At the moment, Stanford has a lot going for it. It has won five of its past six games. It swept the L.A. schools last week, including a 24-point defeat of UCLA. And everybody is reasonably healthy now that point guard Daejon Davis is back from a two-game absence. Who:  Stanford (14-11, 7-6 Pac-12) at Arizona St. (17-8, 8-5) Where:  Tempe, Ariz. When:  6 p.m. TV:  ESPN2 In his return, he had 12 points and 11 assists with just one turnover against the Bruins. “I love the way the guys fought for me in the USC game,”  Davis said, referring to Stanford’s 79-76 win. Against UCLA, “I knew I had to come out and play with passion and match the energy and moment that we had while I was off the court.” He thought the crowd of 5,418, Stanford’s largest home crowd of the season, was a key factor in the win. “I can’t thank those guys enough, especially for our senior,” Josh Sharma, Davis said. “It was one of his last home games ever. It means a lot to us to have that type of support in Maples.” Now the Cardinal have to win in front of an opposing crowd — and they’re  4-7 on the road. ASU is tied with Utah for third  in the Pac-12 at 8-5, but after first-place Washington (11-1), the next eight teams are packed tighter than a sardine can, from second-place Oregon State (8-4) to ninth-place UCLA (6-7). The Sun Devils are the top rebounding team in the conference, mainly because of Pac-12 leader and San Diego State transfer Zylan Cheatham (11 per game). They’re 11-3 at home, but even there, they’re unpredictable. Two nights after being pounded by lowly Washington State, they handed Washington its only conference loss. “They feed off energy, and it’s going to be a great crowd,” Stanford head coach Jerod Haase said. “They understand how big the game is. We expect to get their best punch certainly.” Although Stanford was explosive offensively against UCLA, Haase said, “Defensively is probably our greatest room for improvement.” Against ASU, “we need to really guard the ball and keep it out of the paint.” ASU’s top scoring threat is Luguentz Dort, a freshman guard from Montreal who averages 16.4 points a game. “They do a great job driving downhill getting to the rim and the free throw line and playing with energy on both ends of the floor,” Haase said. “Obviously, we need to match that.” He reiterated what he said after the UCLA game, that the Cardinal have by no means “arrived.” “From start to finish, we’ve talked about this being a stair-step approach, where we’re trying to make incremental gains,” he said. “I think we’re doing that. To get a road win at ASU would be a significant incremental gain.”As Damian Jones stepped to the edge of a huge pit of fake marshmallows, a half-dozen or so parents with their children exchanged confused glances. “It’s not that deep, so don’t jump!” shouted John Goodman, co-founder of the traveling candy-themed exhibit Candytopia on Market Street in San Francisco. With all the joy of a child seeing a ball pit for the first time, Jones — the Warriors’ 7-foot, 245-pound center — lowered himself into it, crouching down before diving sideways into a sea of 250,000 foam marshmallows. After a couple of minutes, the 23-year-old climbed out, shook his head and said with a chuckle, “Not going to lie, that was pretty lit.” When Warriors fans look at Jones, they see a world-class athlete with a 7-foot-3¾-inch wingspan and a 36-inch vertical leap. They see a raw big man who, before  sustaining a potentially season-ending pectoral injury   Dec. 1, had become the team’s go-to target on alley-oop dunks. They see a young player who smiles and nods whenever  center DeMarcus Cousins peppers him with pointers on the sideline. What they don’t see is the giggly introvert who majored in engineering science at Vanderbilt. Though many young NBA players revel in their newfound wealth and fame, Jones spends his free time beating his newest video game, reading comic books on his iPhone and scouring NBA cities for the best doughnut shops. As the clock winds down on 2018, The Chronicle profiles 10 influencers who will shape the Bay Area sports landscape in 2019. “He’s a big kid at heart,” his mother, Dana Jones, said of Damian, who is  the Warriors’ only center under contract for next season. Though he has yet to master such basics as boxing out or staying out of foul trouble, Jones has shown enough upside for his teammates to nickname him “Hundred Million.” After rehabbing from a torn left pectoral muscle, Jones should be a key cog in Golden State’s frontcourt rotation next season. “There’s no doubt in my mind that he could sign a $100 million contract someday,” forward Alfonzo McKinnie said of Jones. “He’s super athletic, strong.” Jones’ youth was evident on a late-fall afternoon after a Warriors practice. In one of Candytopia’s final rooms, a laughing Jones lay on his back as two employees poured buckets of confetti on him. One young boy pointed toward Jones and shouted, “Look, Dad, it’s Kevin Durant!” Jones shrugged off the mis-identification. “It’s cool to get any sort of recognition,” he’d say later. “But to be honest, I don’t really pay much attention to it.” What does get Jones’ attention are video games. His post-Candytopia plans that evening: complete his final mission on “Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Wildlands.” Then start on “Assassin’s Creed: Origins.” Beat that, too, and he’d move  to the new “Spider-Man.” “The schedule is based on when I got these games,” Jones explained. “That’s how I do it. You’ve got to beat the whole game. That’s how I’ve always been.” Jones’ need to finish what he starts was instilled at an early age by his parents, Dana, a secretary at Living Word Church in Baton Rouge, La., and David, a supervisor at the NRG energy plant in nearby New Roads. The eldest of three boys, Damian was an assistant leader for Living Word’s Sunday school program throughout middle school and high school. He seldom missed services on Thursday evening or Sunday morning. To help shield him from area gangs, Dana limited whom her son could hang out with and signed him up for after-school programs. Jones grew up hearing a familiar edict: “Pride comes before the fall. If you are prideful in what you have, you can easily lose it all.” Not that their son didn’t have much to be proud of. He was a strong student in math and science, attending a distant magnet school in junior high that required a 4:50 a.m. wake-up time to make a 7 a.m. bell. After the head of a magnet high school focused on engineering visited one day, Jones asked his mom which branch of engineering was the most lucrative. He thought his smarts would be his ticket out of Louisiana. Basketball soon would take him far, though. He honed his game at Sports Academy, a basketball hothouse that had helped produce NBA players such as Glen “Big Baby” Davis, Tyrus Thomas and Brandon Bass. In the summer before his senior year of high school, Jones joined the Texas Titans, a prestigious Amateur Athletic Union team owned by telecom billionaire Kenny Troutt. Every other weekend, Troutt had a private jet fly Jones to his Dallas mansion for practice. After playing for the Titans alongside Julius Randle (now with the New Orleans Pelicans), Jones became a top-100 prospect nationally, attracting interest from colleges including Duke, Kansas and Syracuse. But Vanderbilt, with its renowned engineering department, most intrigued Jones, whose high school classes in digital logic and computer-aided design had made him appreciate the intellectual challenge of solving problems on the fly. When he wasn’t playing ball, Jones interned at ExxonMobil’s aviation plant in Port Allen, La. While shadowing the plant manager, he became inspired. “I always was into engineering, but seeing his job, I was able to really see what I’d want to do with it,” Jones said. “I just loved the idea of running projects, the logistics of everything, making sure everything goes smoothly. Timetables and schedules are cool to me.” An affinity for time management came in handy at Vanderbilt. After a rocky start academically, Jones settled into a rhythm, finishing his engineering assignments early to focus on basketball. By his junior year, he was on the dean’s list — and the All-SEC first team. What most impressed Laurie Woods, a lecturer in Vanderbilt’s sociology department, was that Jones was generous with his time, despite having one of the most chaotic schedules on campus. After games, he signed autographs for every fan who asked. Rarely did he turn down a lunch or dinner invite from Woods or one of her colleagues. “He can look a little bit naive at times, but there’s something in him that’s so solid,” said Woods, who served as a sort of maternal figure for Jones at Vanderbilt. “He’s not anybody you have to worry about.” In April 2016, after three seasons with  the Commodores, Jones declared for the NBA draft. Considered a possible mid-first-round pick, Jones slid to Golden State at No. 30 overall after a pectoral-muscle injury he suffered during a workout hurt his stock. He left Vanderbilt just 23 credits shy of graduating and is hoping to take an engineering class at Cal in the spring. Assuming he won’t have to participate in another summer league, Jones will try to finish more credits at Vanderbilt in July. “He always said he was going to make a lot of money,” Dana Jones said. “When he was a kid, I don’t think he ever would’ve thought it’d be in the NBA.” As he left Candytopia, Jones remembered that one of his favorite doughnut shops, Bob’s Donuts and Pastries on Polk Street, was nearby. “I got to see my name on that wall,” Jones said, referring to Bob’s Hall of Fame wall. Jones had promised Warriors strength coach Michael Irr after the team’s sweep of Cleveland in the NBA Finals in June that he wouldn’t eat another doughnut until he took on Bob’s Donut Challenge, which calls for the challenger to eat “The Big One” — a doughnut weighing in at nearly a pound — in less than three minutes. On June 28, Jones needed  1 minute, 59 seconds to eat the massive doughnut, good enough to get his $10.95 refunded, a free drink, a Bob’s Donuts T-shirt and, most important, his name on the store’s Hall of Fame. On this visit, he ordered three regular-size glazed doughnuts. After biting into the first one, Jones said sheepishly, “This is my first doughnut in three or four weeks, and I probably won’t have another one for another month.” Doughnuts have long been Jones’ biggest vice; he has a go-to shop in almost every NBA city. Jones reckons that the best thing about Santa Cruz, where he spent much of the past two seasons playing for Golden State’s G League affiliate, is Ferrell’s Donuts, home to one of his favorite blueberry doughnuts. He’d regularly stop by Ferrell’s before heading to the city’s boardwalk arcade to play the classic spaceship shooting game “Galaga.” “They still have my high score up there,” Jones said. With David West (retirement), Zaza Pachulia (Pistons) and JaVale McGee (Lakers) gone, Jones quickly became a fixture at center for the Warriors while Cousins worked his way back from a torn Achilles tendon. Jones took a big step toward his ambitions in late October. While Jones was playing “Dragon Ball FighterZ” during a team flight home from Chicago, the Warriors’ chief legal officer, David Kelly, handed him a letter. Golden State had picked up Jones’ $2.3 million option for the 2019-20 season. “Cool,” Jones told Kelly, then resumed his video game. “He’s the total opposite of me,” said Dana Jones, who cried when her son told her the news on the phone later that day. “I would be shouting and jumping, but he never gets too high or too low. I think that’s why he’s handled all this change so well.”It was well over 100 degrees when UC Davis opened the 2011 season at Arizona State. It was about to get even more uncomfortable for the Aggies. Not only did they lose 48-14, but the Sun Devils — led by ferocious linebacker Vontaze Burfict — inflicted numerous injuries on Davis. The Aggies lost three of their next four games and finished 4-7. The season turned into a long struggle, in no small measure because of that one game. “They had some NFL guys up front and at linebacker,” said Tim Plough, the Davis offensive coordinator who was the quarterbacks coach that year. “We had a bunch of guys hurt. We lost a lot of guys to Fresno State, too,” referring to a 51-0 loss in 2009. Those games were “revenue games,” in which lower-level programs receive large payments in return for routinely taking a severe beating on the field. On Saturday, Stanford will host UC Davis, and Cal will take on Idaho State in Berkeley. Both matchups involve a payout to the less prominent teams coming to call. Such games have become an annual ritual across the country, causing many fans to grumble about the mismatches. The games are part of  season-ticket packages and TV viewers tend to switch channels in the second quarter of lopsided games. At a time when the connections between playing football and long-term health issues have been established, critics say these one-sided matchups put too much of a physical burden on players as athletic departments try to keep from losing money. Occasionally, to be sure, David does beat Goliath. In 2005, Davis came into Stanford Stadium as a heavy underdog and trailed 17-0 in the second quarter. But the Aggies rallied and won 20-17 on a touchdown pass with eight seconds left. Plough called the game “a top-five moment in my life, and I didn’t even play.” He was a backup quarterback. But, more regularly, revenue games exact a heavy cost. David Grenardo, a former Rice cornerback who teaches law at St. Mary’s University in San Antonio, says the revenue games are humiliating for the losing team. “When we played Ohio State at the Horseshoe in 1996, and we felt like this was our chance to show everybody what we’re made of and a chance to showcase our school,” he said in a phone interview, “we didn’t realize we were basically lambs being led to the slaughter. We held them to 70 points.” The 70-7 trouncing “was demoralizing,” he said. “When the NCAA talks about how college sports help educate you and get you ready for life, I can’t think of anything more embarrassing than playing on that field. The only thing it taught me was that I was not going to be a professional football player and I should start getting ready for law school.” The weaker teams are beaten physically, he said. “If there are not serious injuries, there can be a soreness like you’ve never felt before. Our coaches said, ‘They put their pants on one leg at a time just like us,’ and I’m thinking, ‘Yeah, but it takes them a lot longer to put on their pants because they’re a lot taller and bigger.’” What’s more, Grenardo said, “The NCAA wants a good product on the field, but these games are awful to watch. If you’re a casual fan, these games will turn you off to college football because they’re not competitive. I’d rather turn on an NFL game because it’s at least most likely going to be close. There’s a lot more parity than there is in college football, especially these games at the beginning of the season.” Out of necessity For Davis, Sacramento State and other smaller programs, revenue games occasionally can be win-win opportunities, as was the case when the Aggies beat San Jose State 44-38 in this year’s opener and picked up $400,000 in the process. Sacramento State regularly plays in revenue games. While a drone flew over a practice this summer, shooting video to give the coaches a bird’s-eye look at the players, athletic director Mark Orr spoke to The Chronicle about why he’s happy to schedule these mismatches. “We won’t play too many of them, just because you want to give your student-athletes a competitive experience, to stay healthy and prepare for the conference season,” Orr said. But if such games were off limits for any reason, “it could be a significant blow,” Orr said. Would he have to drop one or two of the school’s 21 sports? “I wouldn’t think it would be that drastic. But you’d certainly have to find the revenues or reduce expenses from another area.” The Hornets visited San Diego State on Saturday and next year play both Arizona State and Fresno State. The payouts for the less prominent schools in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), which used to known as Division I-AA, aren’t nearly what they are for the powerhouse schools in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), previously Division I-A. Alabama reportedly will pay Utah State $1.91 million for a 2022 game, rivaling the largest payouts ever: Florida’s $2 million to Colorado State for a game this year and Auburn’s $1.937 million to Tulane for a game next season. Utah State, Colorado State and Tulane are FBS schools. FCS schools play for a fraction of those sums. Orr, a former Cal defensive back, has booked a game in Berkeley in 2021. For Sacramento State players, he said, the experience of playing such games “is something they’re going to remember the rest of their lives.” He pointed out that Sac State beat Oregon State in 2011 and Colorado (on a last-play field goal) in 2012. “It’s not like we’re going into these games thinking we’re going to get crushed,” he said. Just finding any school to schedule can be a challenge, Orr said. “The Big Sky Conference is the only FCS conference west of the Mississippi,” he said. “You’ve got three nonconference games that you have to get. “Your job is to find another FCS opponent that’s not in your conference, so that means somebody out of region. Or you play a non-Division I team, and there aren’t many Division II teams on the West Coast anymore.” As a result, Sac State scheduled the University of St. Francis, a 3,300-student school in Illinois, and Northern Colorado, a Big Sky team but in a nonconference game. A balancing act Dan Hawkins, in his second year at Davis after head-coaching stints at Boise State and Colorado, has been on both ends of revenue games. “It’s a great opportunity for our guys to play those people,” he said of this year’s game at Stanford and next year’s at Cal. “It’s fun for our guys to get in those stadiums. Sometimes it’s an opportunity to get on TV.” The biggest disadvantage in those games, he said, is that FCS teams like  Davis get 63 athletic scholarships as opposed to 85 for  FBS schools. But he said, “It’s fun for us to match up against Stanford. It’s a great academic institution. And Cal is kind of a sister school for us.” Josh Slushman, who handles football scheduling as  Davis’s associate athletic director, said the school won’t  play just anybody at the higher level. “Hawk doesn’t want us to get beaten up,” he said. “There are some schools that he’d want us to avoid.” Stanford is the No. 9 team in the country but, unlike some other schools, probably won’t keep its starters on the field long after a game turns one-sided. Every year, you see major mismatches on college schedules. Football powerhouses playing little-known schools. Texas vs. San Jose State. Cal vs. Presbyterian. Stanford vs. UC Davis. Why does college football feature these lopsided games, which the bigger schools often win by landslide scores? The Chronicle investigates the questionable tradition of “revenue games.” To read the entire series, go to bit.ly/RevGames. Part 1:   Why college football plays these annual blowouts. Part 2 :  Why colleges should be ashamed of these games. Part 3 :  San Jose State: How it makes millions. Here are some of the most memorable revenue-game upsets of the past two decades: Year Score Of note 1999 La. Tech 29, Alabama 28 The backup QB threw a 28-yard TD pass on the final play. 2007 Appalachian St. 34, Michigan 32 The Mountaineers got $400K to play at Big House. 2010 James Madison 21, Va. Tech 16 Jamal Sullivan went 77 yards on a swing pass. 2010 Jacksonville St. 49, Miss. 48 (OT) The winning two-point conversion was caught in a crowd. 2012 Texas State 30, Houston 13 The Cougars’ offensive coordinator resigned two days later. 2012 La. Monroe 35, Arkansas 31 (OT) QB Kolton Browning: 412 yards, 3 TDs, rushed for winning TD. 2013 Ga. Southern 26, Florida 20 Eight Eagles had at least one run of 10 yards or longer. 2016 North Dakota St. 23, Iowa 21 FCS power beat the No. 13 Hawkeyes on a last-play FG. 2017 Howard 43, UNLV 40 Caylin Newton (Cam’s brother) had 330 total yards. 2017 Liberty 48, Baylor 45 Stephen Calvert threw for 447 yards and 3 TDs for the Flames. Wide receiver Keelan Doss, an Alameda native who had 115 catches for a school-record 1,499 yards last year, said, “If I had a choice, I’d play in those environments every weekend, even if we went out there and got beat. I just enjoy the challenge.” It generates interest among Aggie alumni, too. Davis officials say it has about 101,000 alumni in the Bay Area. Another 50,000-plus aren’t far away. Athletic director Kevin Blue, who previously worked for Stanford as senior associate athletic director for external relations, said, “It’s helpful for our program to compete against a team like Stanford this year. We have a similar value system with respect to the student-athlete and the priority of academics. It’s a natural fit for us.” Accepting the challenge Sacramento State head coach Jody Sears doesn’t see revenue games as a liability for his program. “I’ve been at this level for a long time, and I love the fact that our kids get to go and play against the big boys,” he said. Recalling a 55-14 trouncing at the hands of Cal in 2014, his first year at Sac State, he said, “I screwed that up. We didn’t have a good plan defensively.” On a 49-0 loss to Washington in 2015, he said, “We hung with them for about a quarter. They were just starting to hit their stride.” A 31-3 loss to Fresno State in 2016: “We played them tough. We hung with them for three quarters.” Senior linebacker Malcolm Thomas has fond memories of the Washington game despite the drubbing. “It was my freshman year, and it was my birthday,” he said. “To be on that field and see the Pac-12 logo and stuff like that — it was a fun experience.” Wide receiver Dewey Cotton, a redshirt freshman from Stockton, was looking forward to a visit to San Diego State. “It’s a time where we can show off ourselves, and we can be underdogs — and beat them,” he said. Not this time. The Hornets lost 28-14 Saturday. Cotton might be the smallest player in America: 5-3½, 150 pounds. Will opponents think he’s too small to worry about? “I hope they have that mind-set for me, so I can prove them wrong,” he said.I loved playing football. The camaraderie. The physical and mental challenge. The sheer speed and chaos of it all. It wasn’t always fun. I suffered a concussion on my very first play of varsity football as a sophomore. I remember vomiting on the sideline and running right back out there. That’s just what you did. And I still loved most every minute of it. When the drums began to play on Friday nights, my heart would race in anticipation. I still get amped when I hear that sound. As I’ve written before, my teammates and I used to joke that football was “sanctioned violence ... with all your friends.” Sadly, the joke was on us. Thirty years removed from the last time I buckled a chin strap, the true cost of football has come into clear focus. The sport I loved to play. The sport we love to watch, on Friday nights, on Saturday afternoons, on Sundays and Mondays and Thursdays, too. The sport of football is a killer. It’s not a matter of much debate anymore, after decades of denial. Scientific evidence has shown a clear connection between repeated head trauma suffered while playing football and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative brain condition that can manifest itself in a slew of awful ways, including depression, aggression, dementia, Parkinson’s disease — and suicide. After seeing generations of its players suffer, the NFL acknowledged the link only in 2016. Medicine has a long way to go to refine the research and seek out treatment options. But if you’re still in doubt, read this summary of findings  from a Boston University study conducted by Dr. Jesse Mez , and published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association. “In a convenience sample of 202 deceased players of American football from a brain donation program, CTE was neuropathologically diagnosed in 177 players across all levels of play (87%), including 110 of 111 former National Football League players (99%).” The Deer Valley High School football team takes the field before its 2017 season opener against Monte Vista-Danville in Antioch.

Junior Seau. Those are some of the bigger names in the game who took their lives rather than live with the pain and suffering. That’s a price no one should have to pay. Most of the coverage surrounding this issue has focused on establishing the link between football and brain disease. Some of the coverage has focused on the ensuing lawsuits filed by former players against the NFL. Still more has examined treatment possibilities. All important work, but now that we can see the problem, serious questions remain. Now that we know football is destroying some of its most dedicated and talented participants, what are we going to do about it? How can we protect these players? Should children play football? What will football look like in the future? The Chronicle set about addressing these questions, focusing on three major areas.  Current efforts to change the game in the NFL .  The impact of declining youth participation .  How the game might look in the years and decades to come . One thing most everyone can agree on is this: Football is a multibillion-dollar business, and no one is going to walk away from that table. The powerful forces of the NFL, the NCAA, shoe and apparel companies, television, the advertising and video game industries — they all depend on the sport for major revenue. So who are we kidding? Nothing’s going to change, right? Not necessarily. The NFL and NCAA both see dwindling numbers in participation. They see declining ratings. They see legal exposure. And they’re worried. Maybe, just maybe, the drive for self-preservation will foster meaningful change. For that to happen, the game needs to enact reform on a number of fronts. The Aspen Institute in Colorado, a nonprofit think tank focused on the study of the humanities, has explored this issue for years, most recently conducting a symposium in early 2018 . This year’s lineup of speakers included former 49ers linebacker Chris Borland, who walked away from a promising NFL career after his rookie season, fearing brain damage. In terms of legislating the danger of football, with rule changes and “safe tackling,” Borland spoke to the panel in blunt terms. “Between 2009 and 2014, my freshman year at Wisconsin and my rookie year with the 49ers, I made about as many tackles as anyone on the planet. There’s no way to do it entirely safely.” Also in attendance was Dr. Robert Cantu, co-founder of the CTE Center at Boston University, which has been leading the way in medical research into the disease. Regarding youth football, where tackling leagues are more prevalent in poor communities, Cantu issued a warning. “I have a real problem and a real concern,” Cantu said at the seminar. “What we are potentially doing, on a socioeconomic basis, is selecting out a segment of youngsters to take on a much greater burden of brain trauma at an early age, and set them up for being less cognitively developed as they would have been otherwise.” “To have impulsivity issues, as they reach adulthood. And depression and panic attacks. Essentially, because of socioeconomics, you’re not giving them another option that they would have done. Now you’re subjecting them to needless head trauma.” As for the future of the game,  the symposium resulted in a white paper advocating that youths play flag football,  a less violent version of the sport, until they reach high school. Borland was quoted as saying: “I’m somewhat incredulous that we even discuss the reasonability of hitting a 5-year-old in the head hundreds of times. It baffles me inside. I think you can wait to play.” I agree, Mr. Borland. Football is a super-violent game that can damage your brain. There is no debate here. If football wants to avoid the fate of boxing, which went from the top of the American sports food chain to the sleazy margins of society, it needs to address the violence. Here are four concrete ideas from me. I’d like to hear yours. In one of the more disturbing injury incidents of the 2017 NFL season, Houston Texans quarterback Tom Savage is checked by a referee after being hit in a game against the 49ers on Dec. 10 in Houston. The hit left Savage on the ground for several minutes, arms trembling; he later returned to the game, and afterward he was diagnosed with a concussion. •Reform. In the near term, the NFL and NCAA need to keep working on making the game safer through rule changes and equipment innovation. It will change the game. Some people won’t like it. But that’s the right thing to do. •Protect. At the high school level, coaches should reconsider smash-mouth offensive styles. They should ensure the best possible,  certified  trainers are on the sideline for games, ready to respond with medical attention. Raise money for better helmets, not fancy road trips. And don’t send those kids back on the field after they get “their bell rung,” like my coach did some 30 years ago. Wake up to the realities of brain trauma, people. •Legislate. Let’s institute a ban on tackle football for children until high school. Such an effort — AB 2108, or the “Safe Football Act” — failed in California this past year. Never made it to committee for lack of support. Let’s try harder. •Evolve. And, as we move into the future, let’s change the game fundamentally. I believe a move toward a wide-open game, played with more skill, less people and less equipment, is the path to the future. Football of the future may not look much like it does today. But we started playing this game with no helmets. So many players were getting hurt, even killed in the early days of college football, that President Teddy Roosevelt stepped in and brokered rules changes that helped clean up the sport back in 1906. We could use some of Roosevelt’s resolve now, well over 100 years later. Al Saracevic is sports editor of The San Francisco Chronicle.

Del Valle floods:  In the East Bay hills, high inflows from Arroyo Valle raised Del Valle Reservoir over its banks  Friday and threatened the campground and recreation facilities. The park will be closed through March 3, said Jen Vanya at East Bay Parks. Mammoth Mountain:  At the 11,053-foot summit, season snowpack was measured at 543 inches, with a 225-inch base snowpack, reported Tim LeRoy from Mammoth. Visualize that. Rare sighting:  At Pillar Point Harbor, kayaker Bart Selby saw a northern gannet, a  bird from the north Atlantic Ocean. His sighting was verified by bird experts. “I assume that means it had to come through the high Arctic,” Selby said. No. 1 in California:  A rain gauge at Venado in the Russian River watershed, located north of the Armstrong Redwoods, hit 69.72 inches for the season, the highest in California. Water watch:  At Lake Berryessa, the gauge hit 93 percent full and the water level needs to come up  10 feet to spill into a bell-mouth called the Glory Hole. Giant Shasta:  The state’s No. 1 recreation lake, Shasta Lake, hit 73 percent full, high enough to open all of the boat ramps, and up from about 45 percent  since December. It hits peak in mid-May. Good and bad timing:  Conditions appear nearly perfect for Monday and Tuesday to be among the best ski days of the year at Tahoe, with cold, clearing weather and surface conditions refreshed by sugary powder, runs groomed into soft corduroy. Problem is, the timing was a disaster for many travelers, and they will miss it; Interstate 80 and U.S. 50 were closed off and on  because of blizzards and avalanche warnings  Thursday night, and parts of Friday and Saturday. Bad surprise:  Those renting vacation homes at Tahoe during big snowstorms can arrive and find the driveways of their rentals buried in high snow, reported field scout Geoff Chin.Matt Duchene appreciated how short the walk was to join his new team. Sergei Bobrovsky made 22 saves, and Duchene’s first game with the Columbus Blue Jackets was a 3-0 win over his former team, the Senators, on Friday night in Ottawa. Duchene, one of the top players available ahead of Monday’s NHL trade deadline, was dealt by Ottawa to Columbus hours before the game. He was held pointless, but Josh Anderson, Cam Atkinson and Oliver Bjorkstrand scored for the Blue Jackets, who moved into third place in the Metropolitan Division. “I enjoyed myself out there,” Duchene said. “It was kind of a good way to end my time as a Sen, and I probably felt more comfortable because I was in this building (rather) than had we gone somewhere else.” Duchene, 28, was dealt for a 2019 first-round draft pick plus top prospect forwards Vitaly Abramov and Jonathan Davidsson. Columbus also got minor-league defenseman Julius Bergman. Columbus will send an additional 2020 first-round draft pick to Ottawa if it is able to sign Duchene to a contract extension. He can become an unrestricted free agent after the season. Duchene received an ovation from the crowd when he was introduced in the starting lineup. The Senators, who were shut out for the second straight game and have lost three straight, have gone 125 minutes and 17 seconds since their last goal. Columbus hosts the Sharks on Saturday. Flames 2, Ducks 1:  Andrew Mangiapane scored the go-ahead goal with 3:29 left and host Calgary won its fourth straight to move three points ahead of San Jose atop the Pacific Division. The Flames lead the Western Conference standings as well. Jets 6, Golden Knights 3:  Patrik Laine scored twice and Connor Hellebuyck made 31 saves to lead Central Division-leading Winnipeg in Las Vegas. The victory was Paul Maurice’s 685th as an NHL coach. He passed Pat Quinn for sole possession of eighth on the career list. Avalanche 5, Blackhawks 3:  J.T. Compher scored his second goal of the game on a breakaway to snap a tie with 5:22 left in the third period, and visiting Colorado won its third straight. Patrick Kane scored his 39th goal to extend his points streak to 20 games and goal-scoring run to five for Chicago. The Avs stayed one point behind Minnesota for the West’s final wild-card spot. Wild 3, Red Wings 2:  Luke Kunin and Jordan Greenway scored in the first period for visiting Minnesota.

The Sabres placed forward Kyle Okposo (concussion) on injured reserve.Aleah Goodman had 22 points and No. 12 Oregon State snapped No. 2 Oregon’s 17-game winning streak with a 67-62 victory  Monday night. It was just the second loss of the season for the Ducks, who defeated the Beavers 77-68 on Friday in the first game of the rivalry series. Oregon (24-2, 13-1 Pac-12) was hampered by the loss of starter Ruthy Hebard in the first half with what appeared to be a right knee injury. Destiny Slocum finished with 20 points and the Beavers (21-5, 11-3) extendedtheir  winning streak over the Ducks at Gill Coliseum to nine games. Oregon hasn’t won in Corvallis since 2010. The Ducks moved up a spot to No. 2 in the AP rankings earlier in the day. It is the Ducks’ highest poll position in school history. The Beavers dropped from No. 9 following the loss in Eugene on Friday. It was a tense final period. A layup by Sabrina Ionescu (Walnut Creek) tied the game 50-50 early in the  quarter, and her jumper pulled the Ducks in front with 6:23 left in the game as the Beavers went on a scoring drought. Mikayla Pivec’s layup for the Beavers tied it again with 4:25 to go. Slocum’s jumper gave them back the lead. Maite Cazorla’s basket cut Oregon’s deficit to 59-57 with 35 seconds left. #5 Notre Dame 95, #9 N.C. State 72:  Arike Ogunbowale scored 22 points and the visiting Irish (24-3, 11-2 ACC) took control with 12 straight points in a dominating third quarter in which Notre Dame scored 34. Freshman Elissa Cunane scored 28 points for the Wolfpack (22-3, 9-3). MEN #3 Virginia 64, #20 Virginia Tech 58:  Kyle Guy scored 23 points and the visiting Cavaliers pulled away in the second half to sweep the season series from their in-state rival. Ty Jerome added 16 points and De’Andre Hunter had 10 for the Cavaliers (23-2, 11-2 ACC), who won for the sixth time in their past eight visits to Cassell Coliseum. Kerry Blackshear Jr. had 23 points and 13 rebounds for the Hokies (20-6, 9-5). #22 Wisconsin 64, Illinois 58:  Brad Davison scored 18 points, Khalil Iverson added 16 and the Badgers held off visiting Illinois (10-16, 6-9 Big Ten). Wisconsin (18-8, 10-5) ground out a win with leading scorer Ethan Happ on the bench down the stretch. Happ, who averages 18 points, scored just six points on 3-for-7 shooting, was 0-for-3 from the foul line and had three turnovers, including one just before he sat out the final minutes. #23 Kansas State 65, West Virginia 51:  Barry Brown scored 21 points and the visiting Wildcats remained atop the Big 12 standings. A 14-0 run midway through the second half, led by a couple of 3-pointers by Xavier Sneed, gave the Wildcats (20-6, 10-3) their sixth straight conference road win.Almost exactly two years ago, when the Kings unloaded DeMarcus Cousins and Omri Casspi to the Pelicans for Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway and two draft picks, NBA fans lambasted Vlade Divac for his ineptitude:  The critics were only emboldened by an ESPN report that Sacramento owner Vivek Ranadive believed Hield had \"Stephen Curry potential.\" Uttering Curry’s name in the same breath as Hield’s might still seem a bit hyperbolic, but Hield has outpaced plenty of people’s expectations. \"He’s been great,\" Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said Thursday. \"He’s an excellent shooter, obviously, one of the best in the game. He’s improved his ability to shoot off the dribble quite a bit. He just looks more confident. Most guys take a big leap from Year One to Year Two, and from Year Two to Year Three. That’s kind of the window where you really understand the league, and you can make your mark. \"I feel like he’s now in a real comfort zone. He’s in a great spot for him.\" More than two-thirds of the way through his third NBA season, Hield, 26, has failed to score in double-figures just twice. His 44.9-percent clip from beyond the arc ranks fourth in the league, an especially impressive stat given that he is averaging 8.0 three-point tries per game. With Hield serving as the ideal backcourt mate to De’Aaron Fox, the Kings have emerged as the NBA’s feel-good storyline. A team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 sits a game back of the Clippers for the Western Conference’s No. 8 seed. \"I think it’s worked out very, very nicely,\" Gary Gerould — the Kings’ radio play-by-play voice since the franchise moved from Kansas City in 1985 — said of that Cousins trade in February 2017.Cal, loser of a school-record 14 straight, plays Arizona on Thursday night at the McKale Center, which has led the conference in attendance for 33 straight years. As odd as it sounds, that might be a more inviting venue for the Bears than Haas Pavilion has been recently. Before Cal’s Feb. 13 game against UCLA, a season-ticket holder of more than two decades stood in the rain and passed out  flyers directing fans to change.org, where a petition to fire head coach Wyking Jones, who is 13-44 with the Bears. In less than a day, more than 100 people signed the petition. “I understand that our fans want see better results,” Jones said in a statement to The Chronicle. “No one wants to win more than our student-athletes, our staff and me. We’re all competitors and we all have pride. Our focus every day is to help shape high-character young men while building a program that our fans can be proud of.” The petition-touting season-ticket holder — Andrew R. Munday — said he handed out the  flyers until about 20 minutes before the game before being asked by a police officer to move to an off-campus street. Who:  Cal (5-20, 0-13 Pac-12) at Arizona (14-12, 5-8) When:  6 p.m. Where:  Tucson TV/Radio:  FS1/810 Munday said his interactions with  fans were generally fun, despite increased grumbling about the future of the Bears’ program. “After 23 years (as a season-ticket holder), this will be my last. Just pathetic,” Munday wrote on the  flyer that detailed the historically awful statistics that have accompanied the program’s first back-to-back, 20-loss seasons. He said he intends to push his petition digitally for more signatures before sending it to athletic director Jim Knowlton. “We have a young team that is hungry to learn and progressing more each day,” Jones said in the statement. “It’s something that is clear to us in training, practice and games, and although it may not be obvious to everyone watching from the stands or on TV, it is very apparent to us. We are committed to winning the right way and providing the best experience for our student-athletes and our fans, and I truly believe that the success will follow.” Knowlton gave Jones — who has three years and $3 million left on his guaranteed deal — a vote of confidence Jan. 31 in a wide-ranging interview with The Chronicle. The Bears (5-20, 0-13 Pac-12) then had a single-digit margin  in three of their next four losses, but were blown out by 23 against USC on Saturday. “I don’t have any concerns about our confidence,” Jones said. “Our guys should be looking forward to being able to compete and play a game on Thursday to put Saturday’s game in the rearview.” The Bears are 0-8 on the road and 0-3 at neutral sites; their last road win was 77-74 over Stanford on Dec. 30, 2017. Cal has lost six straight and 10 of its past 11 against Arizona. The Wildcats (14-12, 5-8 Pac-12) also are having problems. Arizona is on a seven-game losing streak, the school’s longest skid since 1983, might have its first losing record in conference play since 2008 and has played the past five games without guard Brandon Williams (knee), who is second on the team in scoring (12 points per game) and assists (78). “They’re still a good basketball team. They’ve still got talented guys. They’re still Arizona,” Jones said. “It would be the absolute wrong thing for us to go into this game thinking we have an upper hand because they’re on a losing streak and have some guys out. “We’re going to play them just like we would play anybody else and assume that they’re going to give us their best shot. I absolutely don’t want my guys going into the game thinking that we’re not in an underdog situation.” Arizona is 92-7  at the McKale Center since the start of the 2013-14 season. “It’s important for our team to not get caught up in the external world of: ‘Hey, we’ve lost a number of games in a row,’” Arizona head coach Sean Miller said on the school site’s “Wildcat Basketball Weekly” show. “There are a million streaks we could be accused of breaking. … But it’s about right now.”In February, Josh Begley, a San Francisco native and Cal graduate, finished producing one of the most haunting short films of 2018. For more than five minutes, viewers are presented with stitched-together footage that includes stretchers, motionless bodies, thousand-yard stares and high-impact collisions that result in flying spittle and, on one occasion, a pair of trembling, locked arms that suggest a seizure. Begley’s film, “Concussion Protocol,” is a compilation of every reported concussion from the 2017 NFL season.  An avid football fan who increasingly\\xa0struggles with the game’s violence, Begley wanted to create a historical record of the carnage to which many fans have become desensitized. “We all kind of hear about a concussion crisis in the NFL, and maybe we can all remember seeing a few concussions in the course of watching a game,” Begley said. “But it felt very difficult to see the totality of that, if you were to have aggregated it all, the sum total of that kind of violence.” The 34-year-old Brooklyn-based app developer wound up documenting a historically violent season that  might well be viewed as a tipping point in the way football is played. Last season, despite years of increased attention and resources from the NFL to address its burgeoning health crisis, there was a notable spike in concussions. There were 291 reported concussions across preseason, regular season and postseason practices and games. That’s a 16.4 percent increase from 2016, and the highest number of concussions since the league implemented its current injury-tracking system in 2012. For those charged with making an inherently unsafe sport safer, the spike in concussions was a blow. “That number,” said Dr. Allen Sills, the NFL’s chief medical officer, “obviously alarmed us.” Said Jeff Miller, the league’s top executive for health and safety policy: “I think all of us felt like it was a call to action.” Detroit Lions running back LeGarrette Blount (29) is gang-tackled by Oakland Raiders defenders during a preseason game at the Coliseum on Aug. 10.

Detroit Lions running back LeGarrette Blount (29) is gang-tackled by Oakland Raiders defenders during a preseason game at the Coliseum on Aug. 10. 49ers co-chairman John York, the chairman of the NFL owners’ health and safety advisory committee, said his peers took it as a challenge: “It was a case of ‘we have got to look at this and figure out how to get those numbers to go down.’” With evidence mounting that the sport is dangerous and debilitating, many believe the NFL, which generated about $14 billion in revenue in 2017, must transform itself to protect its long-term health. And the alterations to the sport this season, which are partly inspired by last year’s rash of concussions, could offer the first look into a less violent future for football. Before this season, the league introduced a series of safety-related rule changes. Two directly focused on lessening head trauma: the helmet-lowering rule and modifications to kickoffs. The NFL also made its roughing-the-passer rule more stringent, making it illegal for a defender to land on a quarterback with his full body weight. In addition, for the first time, the NFL banned the use of 10 helmet models that tested poorly for safety, a nod to recent advances in an equipment industry that had long been stagnant due to a lack of competition. So far, the changes appear to be having the desired effect. According to the NFL, concussions in preseason practices and games were down from 91 to 79. Based on The Chronicle’s review of NFL injury reports, there were 42 concussions in the first six weeks of the season, which projects to 121 concussions over the course of all regular-season and postseason games. According to its injury tracking system, the NFL had a yearly average of 168 concussions in the regular season and postseason from 2012 to 2017. Former 49ers linebacker Chris Borland views such  data as deeply flawed. In 2015, Borland retired at 24 after one standout NFL season due to concerns about the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma. Borland had just two diagnosed concussions, both before college, but he says he sustained 13 suspected concussions he didn’t report throughout his football career. “Any specific number with concussions presented as data is, at best, horribly inaccurate,” Borland said. “It’s an ill-defined injury, it’s hard to articulate, players are incentivized to withhold sharing that information. ... So the 291 figure isn’t worth anybody’s focus.” Borland works with Gridiron Greats, a nonprofit organization that assists former NFL players who are in need due to brain injury or chronic pain. He also does advocacy work for the Concussion Legacy Foundation, focusing on the issue of children waiting until at least junior high before playing tackle football. Borland views the NFL’s concussion-inspired rules changes as a public-relations response to forces threatening the sport’s future. In February, a national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found 48 percent of Americans would encourage a child who wanted to play football to participate in another sport due to concerns about concussions, an increase of  eight points since 2014. Borland says the focus on concussion-producing hits ignores sub-concussive collisions. These are smaller impacts, often absorbed by offensive and defensive linemen, that have been linked to brain trauma. Borland says he took an untold number of such lesser hits that resulted in him “seeing stars” or getting “dinged.” “In terms of these measures, frankly, I think it’s P.R.” Borland said. “A third of NFL players don’t have brain injury because a linebacker lands on a quarterback when he sacks him. It has more to do with the repetitive nature of sub-concussive hits baked into the game. And I think that’s an important distinction in talking about concussions and repetitive brain injury. “Because if you present it as concussions, you can present a figure that’s basically pulled out of thin air like the 291 figure and then claim that improvements are being made to address that. When, in reality, the reason so many former players have cognitive impairment is because they hit their head many, many, many times.” Dr. Julian Bailes, seen at the Hollywood premiere of the film “Concussion” in 2015, is a neurosurgeon and a former physician for the Steelers who is one of the leading experts on the long-term effects of brain trauma in NFL players. Since 2002, the NFL has made 50 rule changes designed to make the sport safer, many of them geared toward reducing concussions. But there were indications in the offseason that the latest changes could be transformative. It began with the initial reaction to the helmet-lowering rule, which the NFL’s 32 team owners unanimously approved in March. The rule states that a player,  regardless of position, will be penalized for lowering his head to initiate contact with the helmet against an opponent. That is, actions that are synonymous with football — think of Chicago Bears Hall of Famer Mike Singletary dropping his head to stop a running back — can result in a 15-yard penalty and possible ejection. In the preseason, 71 helmet-lowering penalties were called in 65 games, and it appeared the rule could be a game-changer. Before the preseason, Dr. Julian Bailes, a former Steelers physician who is one of the leading experts on the long-term effects of brain trauma in NFL players, said the rule could signal a significant and progressive shift. “It’s a rule that involves more stringent behavior modification, or playing style modification, than we’ve ever seen,” said Bailes, the director of neurosurgery and the co-director of NorthShore University HealthSystem Neurological Institute outside Chicago. “It’s probably part of the sign of the times. Here football, in this case the NFL, is trying to, quote, ‘figure it out.’” In the preseason, many prominent players worried about the helmet rule changing the sport’s fabric. Among them was 49ers left tackle Joe Staley, a 12-year veteran who has been diagnosed with two concussions since 2011. “I think this is one of those things where you’re going to be really changing the sport,” Staley said. “You’ll be making it safer, but as football players we know there’s some inherent risk in playing a sport that has contact and some violence built into it.” But in the regular season, enforcement of the rule has been nearly nonexistent: In the first six weeks, only three helmet-lowering penalties were called in 93 games. Pittsburgh Steelers inside linebacker Ryan Shazier lies on the field after an injury in the first half of an NFL football game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Monday, Dec. 4, 2017, in Cincinnati. Some believe the preseason emphasis, when 83 percent of helmet-lowering penalties were called on defenders, helps explain this season’s avalanche of scoring. For years, mounting evidence has linked football violence with brain trauma and life-threatening conditions. Now that we know the sport can produce deadly results, where do we go from here?

Online:  Read the full series now at www.sfchronicle.com/future-of-football After the first six weeks, the NFL was on pace to have the most points in league history, as scoring was on track to increase 11 percent from 2017. Niners cornerback Richard Sherman pointed to the new rules as the reason defenses are less effective and offenses are more potent. After six weeks, the NFL was on pace to have 146 roughing-the-passer penalties called in the regular season and playoffs, up from 107 in 2017. Sherman, tongue in cheek, advocated that the NFL put flags on quarterbacks to ensure they don’t get touched. “It’s making it really difficult on (defenses) to combat (offenses) because every rule in the book is designed to make sure you don’t get them stopped,” Sherman said. “They’re just trying to make it impossible for guys to play defense. ... It’s an interesting league we play in.” A less controversial rule change involves kickoffs, a signature play that the NFL has said is about four times more likely to result in concussions than other plays. The hallmark play, which often involves high-speed collisions, has been significantly tweaked this season to reduce them. Most notably, players on the kickoff team can line up only 1 yard behind the line of scrimmage, eliminating the 5-yard running start. The changes come after a 2017 season in which three of the NFL’s fiercest defensive players, Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier, Panthers inside linebacker Luke Kuechly and Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor, sustained troubling injuries. Shazier, 25, who suffered a spinal cord concussion and spent  months in a wheelchair, is unlikely to play football again. Kuechly, 27, who some have labeled the poster boy for the NFL’s concussion issue, sustained his third concussion in three seasons. And Chancellor, 30, was forced to retire in July because of a neck injury, but he expressed concerns about brain trauma on his farewell message on social media: “Pray for your boy,” he wrote. “I have no clue how these head injuries will go after the game.” Still, plenty of current coaches and players resent the changes. In September, Raiders defensive coordinator Paul Guenther said the “rules have gotten a little bit out of control” and called it a shame. Packers linebacker Clay Matthews offered that the NFL is “getting soft” after he was called for a controversial roughing penalty on Washington quarterback Alex Smith, who also disagreed with the flag. “You come to play football, you come to watch a football game, you understand as a player and as a fan that there are certain risks involved in it,” said the 49ers’ Sherman. “And I think the league is trying to supersede those risks.” Sherman has said the NFL’s helmet-lowering rule is an ineffective change, tantamount to “throwing darts at a wall.” The league would counter that its changes were informed by intensive research. In 2016, the NFL committed $100 million to make the game safer. Of that, $60 million was devoted to its five-year Engineering Roadmap, which was designed to improve the understanding of concussion biomechanics and encourage equipment manufacturers and others to develop safer products, with a strong emphasis on the helmet industry. The other $40 million was funneled to medical research. Engineers examined, via video, more than 500 concussion-causing hits in the NFL over the past three years. They  tracked them against more than 100 variables, including factors as disparate as a player’s posture at the point of impact and the time of the game. The research to better understand what happens when players are concussed has also included on-field simulations with crash-test dummies, which are monitored by impact-measuring sensors and 3-D cameras. The study has produced data that led directly to this season’s helmet-lowering rule and kickoff modifications. The review of last year’s 235 concussions sustained in games, for example, found that 46 percent occurred on helmet-to-helmet hits. From 2015-16, only 36 percent of the 458 concussions sustained in games came on helmet-to-helmet hits. The league’s competition committee chairman, Rich McKay, has said 71 of the NFL’s 693 concussions that occurred during games from 2015-17 occurred on kickoffs. Asked whether he feels research is being done with football’s long-term survival at stake, Miller, the league’s top health and safety official, pointed to the elimination of dangerous plays such as the leg whip, head slap and chop block over the years. “I think it’s an ongoing evolution,” Miller said. The “NFL continues to be open to evolution and change. And here we have a level of information, detail and expertise, from the medical and engineering side, that’s helping inform those changes.” Dr. Jeff Crandall, the chair of the NFL Head, Neck and Spine panel’s engineering subcommittee, has done extensive research into auto safety, which uses crash-test dummies to inform many design improvements. And he points to progress made in that arena when asked about the potential limits of improving safety in a violent sport. “Look, we’ve got some outlines to follow here,” said Crandall, the director of the center for applied biomechanics at the University of Virginia. “If you go back to the ’50s and ’60s, they talked about (car) accidents and ‘unavoidables.’ And if you look at what’s been done through injury prevention, and better engineering, and structured public policy programs, you’ve had a 90 percent reduction in serious injury the past three decades. … “I see opportunities to make the game safer. … This is not stuff we are putting together here, and it’s the first time it’s ever been implemented. We are actually borrowing from tried and true practices that have had great success in other areas.” Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch dons his helmet for a workout at the team’s training camp on Aug. 17, 2017, in Napa. The NFL’s study has produced information it has shared with the helmet industry, which now better understands the motion of the head under the most common, concussion-inducing hits. The NFL hopes to have position-specific helmets in 2020. Those for quarterbacks, for example, could be designed to account for the back of the helmet striking the ground when they are hit by defenders and driven backward. In the meantime, guided by advances in NFL-funded helmet testing, the league has banned 10 models this season, including the Riddell that has been worn by Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. The demise of the NFL due to its violence has been forecast for decades. Sports Illustrated did just that with a cover story headlined “Brutality: The Crisis in Football.” That story ran 40 years ago, on Aug.14, 1978. However, there are reasons to believe the NFL’s long-term health has never been in such peril. In July 2017, a study published by the American Medical Association examined the brains of deceased former football players and found that 110 of the 111 brains of those who played in the NFL had CTE, the degenerative brain disease that’s also been found in deceased high school and college players. In June, the family of Washington State quarterback Tyler Hilinski, 21, who committed suicide in January, said an autopsy revealed their son had extensive CTE and the brain of a 65-year-old at the time of his death. Such news could further discourage parents from allowing their children to play football, shrinking the talent pool at all levels. And news in November foreshadowed a time in which medical advances could drive current players out of the game: Researchers said CTE, which previously could be diagnosed only after death, was confirmed for the first time in a living patient. As part of a study published in the journal Neurosurgery, CTE was detected in the brain of former Vikings linebacker Fred McNeil in 2012, and the diagnosis was confirmed when he died in 2015. However, Bailes, the brain trauma expert who was involved in that research, isn’t among those forecasting football’s doom. An independent member of the NFL’s Head, Neck and Spine committee, the neurosurgeon’s enthusiasm for the game remains intact partly because of  recent safety advances that he expects to continue. “It’s still my favorite sport,” said Bailes, who is a volunteer leader of a Pop Warner medical advisory committee that has significantly reduced youth practice contact. “I had two sons who played, and I think it’s America’s greatest sport. ... I’m very much for football. And I believe there’s been a lot of changes made at every level to make it safer. And I think it is safer. I know it’s safer.” It’s notable that the league and the players’ union, the NFL Players Association, which have disagreed on countless issues, have worked collaboratively on the majority of safety-related initiatives in recent years. In the past, the NFL was often viewed as tone-deaf when it comes to the health risks its players assume. CTE was first identified in 2002, in the brain of the late Steelers center Mike Webster, who died at age 50 from a heart attack but had struggled for years with mental illness and erratic behavior, attributed by his doctors to multiple concussions over the course of his 17-year NFL career. But the NFL didn’t publicly acknowledge a link between football and CTE until Miller did so in 2016. The league only recently backed off of the idea of extending the regular season by two games. The NFL continues to draw criticism for weekly Thursday night games that usually allow just three days for players to recover from their previous game. 49ers players take a knee as team personnel tend to defensive lineman Solomon Thomas during the first quarter of a preseason game against the Dallas Cowboys on Aug. 9 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara. Last year, the league reached a concussion class-action settlement worth an estimated $1 billion with more than 20,000 retired players. Sean Sansiveri, who has managed the NFLPA’s health and safety and medical research projects for eight years, says he’s noticed an increased interest from the league in improving player safety. “We have been dragging them in that direction for as long as we’ve been associated with the NFLPA,” Sansiveri said. “It’s still a fight every single day, but on certain issues ... the NFL has certainly been more willing to advance the ball.” Added Sansiveri: “I certainly wouldn’t want to guess at their motivations on any of these issues, whether it’s limiting themselves from liability based on past experiences with class-action suits, or just overall viewership and interest in the game. Regardless, our motivation continues to be protecting the safety, health and wellness of our members.” Sills, a neurosurgeon who was hired last year to occupy the new full-time position as the league’s chief medical officer, is confident that the league’s commitment to safety isn’t fleeting. “I can’t speak to what happened in the NFL before I arrived,” Sills said. “I can only tell you that since I’ve been in the job, I believe that we are walking the talk of making health and safety our No. 1 priority.” But as last year’s 291 concussions illustrate, plenty of work remains. And former President Barack Obama’s words from 2013 remain prescient. “I think that those of us who love the sport are going to have to wrestle with the fact that it will probably change gradually to try to reduce some of the violence,” Obama said. “In some cases, that may make it a little bit less exciting, but it will be a whole lot better for the players. And those of us who are fans maybe won’t have to examine our consciences quite as much.” Why fewer kids are playing football: A study in decline \\r\\n Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email:  ebranch@sfchronicle.com  Twitter:  @Eric_Branch \\r\\nSomething is bothering Tara VanDerveer. The Stanford head coach thinks Pac-12 refs are letting games get too physical. Mainly, she thinks they’re not calling enough fouls on what defenders are doing to Alanna Smith in the paint. “I’m for physical basketball, but not to where you can’t see basketball,” she said. “Every time Alanna goes in, she’s got two or three people chopping her arms off. ... You don’t want your best player getting hurt.” The 6-foot-4 forward from Australia is averaging 20.3 points, fourth best in the Pac-12, and 8.2 rebounds going into Friday’s  home game against Arizona. The No. 7 Cardinal have beaten the Wildcats seven straight times and 31 of the past 32 meetings. Smith might get some help this week if Maya Dodson returns to action. The sophomore forward missed the first eight Pac-12 games because of a foot injury, returned for four games but has missed the past two. Her status for the Arizona game is up in the air. Who:  Arizona (17-8, 7-7 Pac-12) at No. 7 Stanford (21-4, 11-3) When:  7 p.m. Where:  Maples Pavilion In any case, VanDerveer hopes Smith gets a better shake from the officials. She has shot 89 free throws, well behind some of the other forwards and centers in the league. Cal’s Kristine Anigwe has had 214 chances at the foul line, Washington State’s Borislava Hristova 128, UCLA’s Lajahna Drummer 116, Oregon’s Ruthy Hebard 109, Utah’s Megan Huff 108 and UCLA’s Michaela Onyenwere 101. Part of the discrepancy is understandable because 144 of Smith’s 369 field-goal attempts have come from 3-point range. She is hitting 42 percent of those 3s, but she is far less apt to draw fouls when shooting from the perimeter. Still, according to VanDerveer, “Alanna is getting beat up in there. She is responding to the physical play. (But) I don’t think it should be as physical. She’s really battling. I’m admiring her mental toughness.” VanDerveer has referred to  what she considers overly physical players in past years. “I think everybody knows I like a physical game, but a freedom-of-movement game so people can see the athleticism that women have,” she said. “John Wooden said this: If it becomes too physical, you might as well watch football.” She said she talks to officials before every game, but often remains unsatisfied. “My way of seeing basketball is different than how it is,” she said. Last week was productive but painful for Smith. She had 22 points, 13 rebounds and four blocks in a 65-51 win at UCLA. Early in the USC game, she lost the nail on her right index finger but shook off the pain to post 23 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks, hitting the winning layup with three seconds left in a 69-67 victory. She was not only Pac-12 Player of the Week for the third time this season, but also the Naismith Trophy National Player of the Week. She is on track to join Elena Delle Donne as the only players 6-foot-4 and taller over the past 20 years to shoot better than 40 percent from 3-point range in a season. Delle Donne made 41.3 percent as a freshman at Delaware in 2009-10. Stanford clobbered Arizona 78-48 in Tucson this season, but the Wildcats (17-8, 7-7 Pac-12) are getting better. Against Utah and Colorado last week, they pulled off their first Pac-12 sweep since 2010-11. Redshirt sophomore guard Aari McDonald leads the conference in scoring at 24.8 points per game.Antonio Brown’s laundry list of issues with the Pittsburgh Steelers appears to include a problem with how head coach Mike Tomlin treated the Pro Bowl wide receiver during the regular-season finale against Cincinnati and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger’s leadership style. Brown, who has requested a trade, took to Twitter on Saturday to vent in what amounted to his first expanded public comments since a falling out with the organization. Asked by a Twitter user about the root of his conflict with Roethlisberger, Brown responded: “No conflict just a matter of respect! Mutual respect! He has a owner mentality like he can call out anybody including coaches. Players know but they can’t say anything about it otherwise they meal ticket gone. It’s a dirty game within a game. #truth.” Brown also called out Tomlin for the way he handled Brown during the final week of the regular season. The team sent Brown home two days before the season finale and ordered him to get some rest and have his knee examined. Brown arrived at the stadium in time for the game but did not dress after the team made him inactive. “After the coach tell the team I quit while nursing some bumps then invite me to watch the show with same guys thinking I quit,” Brown tweeted. “I can not stand with that!” Obituary:  Gene Littler, whose fluid swing carried him to 29 victories on the PGA Tour and a 1961 U.S. Open title at Oakland Hills, died Friday at 88. Littler held his own among the golfing greats to emerge from San Diego with a tempo to his swing that made the game look easy. Gene Sarazen once said Littler had a perfect swing, like Sam Snead, “only better.” Littler was known as “Gene the Machine,” and he won the first of his 29 tour titles in 1955 at the Los Angeles Open. His most productive year was in 1959 when he won five times, was runner-up three times and finished No. 2 on the PGA Tour money list behind Art Wall. Track and field:  Ethiopian teenager Samuel Tefera broke a 22-year-old indoor world record in the 1,500 meters, clocking 3 minutes, 31.04 seconds at the Birmingham (England) Indoor Grand Prix. Tefera, 19, shaved 0.14 of a second off the mark of 3:31.18 set by Morocco’s Hicham El Guerrouj in February 1997. El Guerrouj holds the outdoor world record of 3:26.00, set in 1998.A potential solution reportedly has emerged late in the Raiders’ search for a home stadium for the 2019 season. According to multiple reports, the cities of Birmingham, Ala., and Tucson  have joined  in a bid to host the team for its final season before moving to Las Vegas in 2020. The cities, which are some 1,500 miles apart, would share the Raiders’ 2019 home games, the  Arizona Daily Star reported.  The venues would be Arizona Stadium, which hosts the University of Arizona football team, and Legion Field in Birmingham, which hosts games for UAB and the Alliance of American Football’s Birmingham Iron, per the report. It likely would be an uneven split: The Raiders are  set to play seven regular-season home games, with their eighth being played in London against the  Bears. The Raiders did not respond to a request for comment. The Birmingham City Council issued a news release  Friday expressing the interest of the city and Council President Pro Tem William Parker in having the Raiders play in Birmingham. “We’re a football town with grit,” Parker said in the news release. “I can’t think of a better place for the Raiders to land this year. We want to make this happen.” The Tucson effort is being led by attorney Ali Farhang, according to the Arizona Daily Star.The Sharks may  be active before Monday’s  trade deadline, even after claiming forward  Micheal Haley  off waivers Wednesday for his second go-around in San Jose. But the team’s bigger decisions  likely will come after the deadline and through early summer. We’re talking potential franchise-altering moves. In many ways, this could be among the most pivotal offseasons in franchise history. And it all likely depends on how this Stanley Cup-or-bust season plays out. Defenseman  Erik Karlsson  and forwards  Joe Pavelski ,  Joe Thornton  and  Joonas Donskoi  are unrestricted free agents. The first three are franchise-pillar heavy hitters. Six additional forwards — led by  Timo Meier  — are restricted free agents. If the Sharks were to win the Stanley Cup, whatever decisions are made will be more readily accepted by a  loyal fan base. But what happens if they lose in the Finals for the second time in four seasons? Or don’t win the West? Or flame out in the first or second round again? Who:  Sharks (36-17-8) at Columbus (33-23-3) When:  2 p.m. TV/Radio:  NBCSCA/98.5 How does management justify bringing everyone back? Who goes? Who stays? One thing that’s certain is that they’re all staying past Monday’s deadline. San Jose has never looked so dangerous heading into the home stretch. Brent Burns  is on a collision course to join Karlsson as a two-time Norris winner.  Marc-Edouard Vlasic ’s half-season hiccup appears on the way to being cured — and he’s probably the best defensive defenseman out there.  Justin Braun  and  Brenden Dillon  are more than complementary pieces on the blue line. This team will want to win it for Thornton, the 39-year-old marvel who has rallied from consecutive seasons of serious knee injuries to find the fountain of youth. Everyone knows it can’t last forever. It might not last past this season if hard decisions need to be made. No one expects Pavelski to be cast aside. The captain knows only of San Jose in his NHL career and he’d look pretty darn strange wearing any other logo. The contract-decision dominoes start to fall with Karlsson. Whether it’s true or a bluff, word came out recently that Karlsson doesn’t want to negotiate until after the season. General manager  Doug Wilson  is a savvy, experienced negotiator and likely has Plans A, B and C ready to go regardless of Karlsson staying or going. But not knowing for several months how a big chunk of change might be spent probably holds up what he plans to do with Pavelski, Thornton and the others. If Wilson adds more forward depth to center a fourth line, or picks up some insurance in goal or does nothing at all before  Tuesday, the next 2-4 months could be the most pivotal during his 15-year tenure and it’s all dependent on what the Sharks accomplish. Why Haley?  Fans might wonder why the team plucked bottom-six forward Haley off waivers from Florida,  for whom he appeared in only  24 games. Part of the reason is to create an even tougher lineup down the stretch, but he also has a track record  with San Jose,  playing 78 games for the Sharks from 2014-16. “He’s very funny, but when it’s time, he knows how to get serious,” Thornton said. “He keeps the guys loose, but if something needs to be said at the right time, he’s there to address it. He brings a lot to this team. We’ve missed him.” Says it all:  How did the Hurricanes react after Hockey Night in Canada’s  Don Cherry  called them a “bunch of jerks” for their scripted postgame celebrations following home wins? Carolina’s marketing department  had T-shirts in the Canes’ colors with “Bunch of Jerks” across the front available within 48 hours. Tracking a deal:  Yes, minor-league defenseman  Julius Bergman  — included in Ottawa’s deal of  Matt Duchene  to Columbus on Friday — is the same prospect the Sharks drafted 46th overall in 2014. San Jose moved Bergman (along with  Mikkel Boedker ) to the Senators last summer in a deal that netted forward  Mike Hoffman , who was flipped to Florida on the same day for three picks. Bergman, 23, has yet to make his NHL debut. Time flies:  Do you believe in miracles? Hard to believe that Friday marked the 39th anniversary of Team USA’s beating the Soviets at the Lake Placid Winter Olympics. And 39 years ago Sunday, the Americans won the gold  by defeating Finland.Golf needs to get tougher. Or maybe you’re cool with the final round of the  U.S. Open at Pebble Beach  starting on Father’s Day and ending on July Fourth. If the wind whips off Carmel Bay, they might not finish until Labor Day. J.B. Holmes  revived this old story line — slow … play … on … the … PGA … Tour — during his glacial stroll to victory Sunday at the Genesis Open. Holmes earned widespread ridicule for his oh-so-deliberate pace. But the PGA Tour shares blame for decades of ignoring the problem. Tour pros already hit shots in churchlike silence. They expect all spectators in the immediate vicinity to stand perfectly still. Most fans even silence their cell phones, and where else on Earth does that happen in 2019? So hit the damn ball already. Please. Holmes stirred  similar backlash  around this time last year, when he took four minutes and 10 seconds to hit an iron shot at Torrey Pines.   That’s longer than the world record in the mile run (3:43.13), as Golf Channel noted. This time, Holmes routinely violated the rule allotting 40 seconds for a player to hit his shot once it becomes his turn. One video making the rounds on Twitter showed Holmes taking more than 70 seconds to contemplate and painfully over-analyze a putt. Zac Blair , another tour pro, re-tweeted the video and called it “ridiculous and beyond disrespectful to your playing partners and golf in general.” Exactly. Golf faces enough challenges in attracting and holding fans. The game is slow by nature, so any unnecessary delays are damaging. Like this here ... is ridiculous and like beyond disrespectful to your playing partners and golf in general  https://t.co/EGFfHJI6MC Holmes takes forever, in part, because he knows there are no consequences. Tour officials historically refuse to enforce pace-of-play rules, out of an illogical fear of embarrassing players. That’s the whole point: Embarrass them so they will play faster. The European Tour experimented with a shot clock at its event in Austria in June, with great success. Players had 40 seconds to hit shots (the first player in a group to approach his ball had 50 seconds); exceeding the limit prompted a one-stroke penalty; and players were allowed two extensions per round. Only four players drew penalties, rounds took about a half-hour less than usual and nearly all players applauded the format in the so-called “Shot Clock Masters.” This approach makes sense because it targets individual players rather than groups for falling “out of position.” The only way to create change is to give players incentive to play faster — and avoiding a penalty shot is huge incentive. Holmes didn’t help his case by speaking defiantly after his victory at Riviera. “Well, you play in 25-mile-an-hour, gusty winds and see how fast you play when you’re playing for the kind of money and points and everything we’re playing for,” he told reporters. “You can’t just get up there and whack it when it’s blowing that hard.” Another example of golf leaders going soft: the  USGA’s decision last week  to issue merely  a warning to Redwood City teenager  Lucy Li , for violating amateur eligibility rules by appearing in an Apple Watch advertising campaign. This one is tricky, especially in an era when the line between amateurs and professionals has become so blurry. But much like Holmes and the slow-play furor, amateur golfers have little incentive to abide by the rules if there are no consequences to breaking them. USGA officials understandably did not strip Li of her amateur status, given that she’s 16 and apparently didn’t realize her participation in the ad breached the rules. Even so, maybe a two-month suspension — through the inaugural Augusta National Women’s Amateur — would have sent an important message. Rules still matter. Briefly:  Nine of the top 10 players in the world ranking (all except No. 1  Justin Rose ) will play in this week’s WGC-Mexico Championship.

But the Mission Bears —  as they have so often in the past decade — found a way to win  Friday night at Kezar Pavilion. For the fifth straight year, the Bears captured the San Francisco Section championship, this time defeating Lincoln  55-46. It was never easy, as the Bears had to withstand a late Mustangs rally before securing their seventh title in eight years and eighth in 10 seasons. “All these championships are great, but this one felt special, because I feel like a lot of people were licking their chops trying to get a piece of us,” Mission coach Arnold Zelaya said. Sophomore Matt Cohn scored 13 points to lead four Mission  players in double digits. Senior Ben Knight — the lone holdover from the Bears’ 36-1, state-title winning team in 2017 — struggled for much of the game but came alive in the fourth quarter to score six of his 10 points. In the absence of Knight’s normal offense — he had been averaging 20 points per contest — the Bears used a balanced offense to withstand the Mustangs, as Mission got solid games from Jaraughn Torno (10 points), David Sonnier (11 points) and Andre Villarino (five points, seven rebounds, six assists.) Cohn scored nine of his game-high point total in the second half. “I knew these guys were down a little bit, so I had to pick them up,” Cohn said. “They’re my family.” Mission took control in a frantic second quarter, using their defense to harass the Mustangs into turnovers that led to easy transition buckets. The Bears closed the half on a 12-4 run, capped by a steal and a buzzer-beating floater by freshman guard Maurice Oliver that put them up 28-20. Leading 40-30 heading into the fourth quarter, the Bears appeared to be in control, but Lincoln chipped away at the lead, doing most of its damage from the foul line. The Mustangs closed to 42-40 on two free throws from Shakur Blaylock (12 points), but Knight responded with back-to-back driving finishes to put the Bears up 46-40. The Mustangs would get no closer than four the rest of the way. Both teams will advance to next week’s Northern California playoffs. Girls Lowell 49, Lincoln 43:  Senior guard KD Lee scored nine of her game-high 24 points in the fourth quarter, helping the  Cardinals (17-8) capture their first San Francisco Section title since 2015 with a win at Kezar. Neither team established control in a tight, back-and-forth affair, in which the largest lead of the game was  seven points. Despite facing a significant size disadvantage, Lowell was able to pull away in the fourth, helped in large part by Lee, who knocked down three  foul shots in the final minute. “We’re undersized, but we pride ourselves on our defensive pressure,”  Lowell coach Matt Magsanay said. “We get in people’s faces, and I think that paid off for us in the fourth quarter. And KD was absolutely clutch.” Lincoln senior center Lily Donovan scored 13 points and pulled down 20 rebounds, but fouled out midway through the fourth quarter. Lincoln (17-14) was seeking its fourth straight section championship.In 1916, Cumberland College, a small private school in Lebanon, Tenn., was scheduled to play Georgia Tech, but there was a slight problem: Cumberland had canceled all of its sports programs for financial reasons the previous spring. A student manager at the smaller school had neglected to inform all parties, and Georgia Tech refused to allow Cumberland to back out of the agreement. So, that same student rounded up 13 members of his fraternity to play the game in Atlanta — saving the school from a $3,000 buyout fee and instead earning $500 for Cumberland. Predictably, the frat brothers were routed by coach John Heisman’s Golden Tornado 222-0, the most lopsided victory in college football history. Heisman, for whom the most famous individual trophy in college sports is named, ran up the score without apology. More than a century later, lesser college football programs are still being sacrificed to larger programs in lopsided matchups commonly referred to as “revenue games” — or, less charitably, “cupcake games.” The practice comes to the Bay Area this weekend, where Cal and Stanford each will host one of the 111 revenue games between mismatched schools scheduled across the college football landscape this season. These games have always been controversial — producing boring games, injured players and disappointed fans — but revenue games remain a scheduling regularity that’s seemingly ingrained in the sport. Many feel it’s an economic win-win in the multibillion-dollar business of college football, while critics argue these games are downright unethical in amateur athletics. “The small schools get a big payday, and the big schools get a victory. It’s a win-win for the schools, but you have to wonder how the players feel about going out and getting slaughtered,” said Woody Eckard, a professor of economics at the University of Colorado Denver business school. “The optimistic ones might think they can win, but in the first five minutes, they’re probably going to change their minds about that.” For college football only, the NCAA has divided Division I schools into two categories: the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). The bigger, top-tier schools compete in the FBS. The smaller schools are grouped in the FCS. Most importantly, FBS teams get to award 85 football scholarships annually, while the lower-level FCS teams get only 63. That creates a virtual guaranteed disparity in the level of talent when schools from the two different divisions meet. How does it work? The bigger schools generally schedule these mismatches, also known as “paycheck games,” to guarantee both the ticket-sale and concession revenue from a home game and an easy win that gets them one step closer to the six victories needed to qualify for a postseason bowl game (which brings with it another payday). The smaller programs get paid by the bigger school to just show up. They cash a sizable check, choose opponents in regions good for recruiting or destinations that create attractive trips for boosters and donors. The trade-off: Players get humiliated — or worse. Sometimes, it’s much worse. In the third quarter of Georgia’s 48-6 drubbing of Southern in 2015, 158-pound Devon Gales was in a violent collision during a kick return that left him paralyzed from the waist down. Georgia paid Southern about $1 million to play the game, approximately one-ninth of the Louisiana school’s total athletic budget for the year. “The (big school) has a huge advantage in size and speed, and the little guys get beat up pretty bad,” said Gary Cavalli, co-founder and former executive director of what is now called the San Francisco Bowl. “So, yes, they come home with a boatload of money, but they also come home with a boatload of injuries that can affect them for the rest of the season. As for the (big school), what did they prove? And, they also run the risk that some pass rusher on the other team may try to make a name for himself by taking out the quarterback.” Southern wide receiver Devon Gales (33) is taken off the field after he was injured in a violent collision during a blowout win by Georgia in 2015.

The Bay Area’s biggest football programs are no strangers to revenue games, almost annually arranging one  amid the 3-D chess it takes to create a college football schedule. In 2011, Cal hosted  Presbyterian, a South Carolina school with 963 undergraduates. After making the longest trip in program history to play the Bears at AT&T Park, the Presbyterian players were pounded  63-13 and  outgained by 533 yards. The Blue Hose were paid $400,000 for their troubles. The annual spectacle repeats itself this weekend, at both Cal and Stanford. On Saturday, Cal will pay $625,000 to host Idaho State, which has had only one winning season since 2003 and last month fired its athletic director. The 11,000-student school in Pocatello, Idaho, plays its home games in Holt Arena, which was built in 1970 and is the oldest enclosed stadium on a college campus in the United States. The football team struggles to average 50 percent attendance in the 12,000-seat facility. Earlier that day, UC Davis will get $650,000 to play at Stanford in a continuation of a series that often prompts grumbling from season-ticket holders forced to pay full freight to watch their team’s starters play about half of the game. (Next year, Cal will pay UC Davis $625,000 to visit Berkeley.) “Games should be competitive, otherwise why play?” longtime Stanford fan Emory Lee of Palo Alto said. “I don’t understand how Alabama fans, for example, can really enjoy watching the other team get pummeled. I was also puzzled by Stanford’s decision to fill in the vacant spot in the schedule with UC Davis. I thought the strength-of-schedule consideration (used by the NCAA when picking year-end bowl teams) would lead Stanford to find a stronger opponent in what should be a great year for Stanford football.” Scheduling controversies For the haves of college football, there’s really no incentive to skip the “cupcake games.” No matter how weak a team’s nonconference schedule is, fans still buy season tickets. The College Football Playoff selection committee doesn’t seem to penalize top teams for booking mismatched revenue games, though CFP Executive Director Bill Hancock said the committee does take them into consideration. “The committee considers all the games and who the opponents are,” he told The Chronicle. “It behooves a team to play as tough a schedule as possible.” Yet, last year’s national champion Alabama and runner-up Georgia, like other Southeastern Conference schools, choose to play their revenue games late in the season (Nov. 17 this year), at a point  when other conferences, like the Pac-12, are beating each other up. If SEC schools can play easy revenue games that late in the season, what about schools in the other major conferences (Big Ten, Pac-12, Big 12 and Atlantic Coast Conference) that — with the SEC — compose the “Power-5”? COLUMBUS, OH - SEPTEMBER 13: Nick Holley #4 of the Kent State Golden Flashes is dragged down by Tyvis Powell #23 of the Ohio State Buckeyes in the first quarter at Ohio Stadium on September 13, 2014 in Columbus, Ohio. (Photo by Jamie Sabau/Getty Images) Such issues have critics calling for reform in the CFP selection process. “The reality is that some Power-5 programs use those smaller programs as a glorified scrimmage, a way to exhale before a big game, a way to ease into a season,” ESPN college football writer Gene Wojciechowski said. “The danger: The CFP selection committee is paying much closer attention to those Power-5 programs that have a heavy appetite for cupcakes.” The week before their annual rivalry games this season, Alabama, Auburn, Georgia and Florida will play, respectively, the Citadel, Liberty, Massachusetts and Idaho. Some see that as an unfair advantage for schools that are competing with other conferences to get into the playoff. While the CFP selection says it’s taking this scheduling issue into account when choosing participants in the four-school playoff that decides the national championship, others aren’t so sure. Cavalli said of the committee’s apparently blasé attitude toward the timing of revenue games: “They’re talking the talk, but they’re not walking the walk.” The Power-5 schools need to “normalize” their schedules, Stanford head coach David Shaw said. “The only way to get to a (fair) four-team playoff is if every team has a similar scheduling rule.” Some critics argue that Power-5 schools shouldn’t play any non-Power-5 teams. When he said he understood that line of thinking, Shaw said he received “a backlash” from the smaller programs who argued that some schools would have to drop football altogether if deprived of revenue games. “The smaller schools on the lower levels have to pay the same amount we have to pay for insurance, equipment, field maintenance,” he said. “If you want to renovate a locker room that’s dilapidated, you just don’t have money on hand to do these things.” When David beats Goliath To be fair to the smaller schools, revenue games aren’t always blowouts. Appalachian State was paid $1.2 million to start this season at Penn State. Though Appalachian State’s starting offensive line was outweighed by an average of 42 pounds, the underdogs took Penn State into overtime before losing 45-38. Technically, Howard’s 43-40 victory over 45-point favorite UNLV in 2017 and Stanford’s 24-23 victory over 40½-point favorite USC in 2007 were bigger upsets, but Appalachian State pulled off the most famous shocker the same year as the Stanford upset. App State went into then-No. 5 Michigan and danced away with a 34-32 win, highlights of which are replayed every season. Cal offensive coordinator Beau Baldwin was the head coach at Eastern Washington in 2013 when it became only the third FCS school to beat a ranked FBS team with a 49-46 victory over Oregon State. “The players just weren’t in awe of anything,” he said. “When I think back on it, I always remember feeling that they weren’t afraid of any of it.” Here are some of the most memorable revenue-game upsets of the last two decades.

Every year, you see the mismatches on college schedules. Football powerhouses playing little-known schools. Texas vs. San Jose State. Cal vs. Presbyterian. Stanford vs. UC Davis.

A1 Al Saracevic:  Bad for players, fans. B1 Thursday/Part 2:  What’s in this for the little guy?

Email  tfitzgerald@sfchronicle.com ,  rsimmons@sfchronicle.com , Twitter:  @tomfitzgerald ,  @Rusty_SFChron  Tiger Woods  will play alongside  Rory McIlroy  and  Justin Thomas  on Thursday and Friday at the Genesis Open. That’s a cool contrast — Woods competing against much younger players who were inspired by his transcendent success early in his career. Phil Mickelson , similarly, will play in the same group as  Jordan Spieth   and  Xander Schauffele . Mickelson, at 48, is a generation ahead of Spieth and Schauffele (both are 25), old enough to be their father. This is one of golf’s enduring beauties, recreationally and, to some extent, at the game’s highest level. Age is no barrier. Generations connect on the course. And maybe they even grapple for major championships. Woods and Mickelson are in tantalizing spots right now, two months ahead of the Masters. Woods contended in the last two majors of 2018 and won the Tour Championship in September. He’s clearly not done. Mickelson nearly won the Desert Classic last month outside Palm Springs, and he did  win the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am  on Monday. He’s defying the outer boundaries of his career, only 16 months from turning 50. “I just think both myself and Tiger are going to have a really, really good year this year,” Mickelson said after completing his victory at Pebble. Let’s hope he’s right. Just picture Woods tussling with McIlroy and Thomas at Augusta National in April. Or Mickelson trying to fend off Spieth and Schauffele — or, say, two-time U.S. Open champion  Brooks Koepka  — at Pebble Beach in June. Woods and Mickelson bring star power, history and familiarity. They will leave the game in good hands when they fade from prominence, but their contention in marquee events still adds a welcome layer of electricity. Davis Love III  considered Mickelson’s longevity last week while standing in the rain after his round at Spyglass Hill. Love has some credibility on this topic: He became the third-oldest winner in PGA Tour history (at 51 years, 4 months), and the oldest since 1975, when he won the Wyndham Championship in 2015. “He’s going to do whatever it takes,” Love said of Mickelson. “He comes up with new theories on diets and exercise. But he looks good, as fit as I’ve seen him in a while. … He’s always going to try to find a way. “We give him a hard time about it, too. He’s always looking for an edge, an angle, a way to get better. That’s why he’s won 40-whatever times.” Mickelson now stands at 44 career wins and Woods at 80. Do not be surprised if those numbers rise by year’s end. Other nuggets in the wake of a wet week at Pebble Beach: • Monterey Peninsula Country Club will remain part of the AT&T Pro-Am rotation. The event is close to finalizing a contract extension with MPCC, tournament director  Steve John  said Wednesday. The current deal expires next year. The extension would run through 2024. Monterey Peninsula’s Shore Course  replaced Poppy Hills in 2010, a swap widely lauded by tour pros. The next question: Could the recently renovated Dunes Course at MPCC, part of the Pro-Am rotation from 1947 through ’66, return to the fray? John said that hasn’t been decided. • Love’s point about Mickelson seeking an “edge” was evident Sunday, when he tried to convince  Paul Casey  that they could keep playing in the dark. The look of disgust on Mickelson’s face when the horn sounded was priceless and, well, kind of ridiculous. On Monday, after completing his win, he backtracked. Mickelson belatedly acknowledged the wisdom of stopping Sunday and returning the next morning to finish in bright sunshine on fresh greens. “Sometimes, I just get in my own little bubble and I don’t see the big picture,” he said. “I was playing well and wanted to finish. … I ended up thanking (Casey) this morning for making that tough call.”The 49ers have picked up a draft pick, but they are still shy of a full allotment. On Friday, the 49ers were awarded a 2019 sixth-round compensatory pick, giving them six selections in the seven-round NFL draft. In 2017, the 49ers traded their fifth-round pick for guard Laken Tomlinson. Last year, they dealt their seventh-round selection for offensive tackle Shon Coleman. The 49ers have just four top-175 selections. They are one of six teams (Bears, Chiefs, Vikings, Saints, Seahawks) with four or fewer top-175 picks. The 49ers could add draft picks via trades. However, if they make just six picks it would match their fewest since 2008. They have averaged 10.5 picks in the past six drafts, and have never had fewer than nine (2018). Here are the 49ers’ draft picks: Round 1:  No. 2 Round 2:  No. 36 Round 3:  No. 67 Round 4:  No. 104 Round 6:  No. 176 Round 6:  No. 212* * Evander Kane couldn’t help himself. Skating near the Penguins’ bench late in the third period Thursday, the Sharks’ forward took a peek at Pittsburgh’s whiteboard, which might — or might not — have written down the time it planned on pulling goaltender Casey DeSmith in an effort to get back into the game. “I like to think a little bit of a savvy veteran thing to do, right?” Kane asked. “If you can see it, why wouldn’t you look at it?” Even if it was hardly necessary. Not with the visiting Sharks well on their way to a  4-0 victory behind two goals from Tomas Hertl and a shorthanded marker by Kane in the first 14 minutes. The Penguins, out of a mixture of frustration at their  sloppy play and Kane’s gamesmanship, took exception, and it bubbled over into a late dust-up that ended with the odd sight of Pittsburgh captain Sidney Crosby mixing it up with San Jose’s Micheal Haley. While Kane tussled with Tanner Pearson, Crosby traded punches with Sharks defenseman Brenden Dillon before Haley — who has nine career goals and 592 penalty minutes — jumped in. The two were separated relatively quickly, and Haley downplayed the notion he was actually brawling with the three-time MVP. “I don’t know if I’d call that a fight,” Haley said. “If all the fights were like that, I’d take it. My body would feel a lot better. No, actually. It’s pretty hard for me to get a hold of guys like him. But things happen in a hockey game, and I’m glad we came out on top.” The scrum ended with Crosby, Haley, Dillon, Pittsburgh defenseman Marcus Pettersson all earning 10-minute misconducts, and Pittsburgh head  coach Mike Sullivan getting ejected. Sullivan declined to get into why he was tossed. He was only a bit more expansive on his team’s first-period pratfall that allowed San Jose to take command. “We take a penalty a minute into the game and it snowballed from there,” Sullivan said. “We gave them three fairly easy goals. It’s hard to overcome that.” “We made a few mistakes early and they happen to be big ones,” Crosby added. Martin Jones stopped all 26 shots he faced to earn his 21st career shutout. Brent Burns picked up his 12th of the season late for the Sharks, whose eighth win in 10 games moved them one point behind Calgary for the top spot in the Pacific Division. Stars 5, Blues 2:  Jamie Benn had his first multigoal game since early October and host Dallas snapped St. Louis’ franchise-record 11-game winning streak. When Benn scored the game’s first goal 3:46 into the second period, the Blues trailed for the first time since Feb. 5 — a span of more than 517 minutes on the ice over 10 games. Capitals 3, Maple Leafs 2:  Alex Ovechkin scored to become the 14th player in NHL history with 650 goals and Braden Holtby made 40 saves for visiting Washington, which has two won in a row. Lightning 2, Sabres 1:  Nikita Kucherov scored the clinching goal in the shootout after scoring his 30th goal of the season in regulation to reach 100 points this season and host Tampa Bay won its eighth in a row. Predators 2, Kings 1:  Roman Josi had a goal and an assist and host Nashville took the Central Division lead with its third win in four games. The Predators have 77 points, one more than second-place Winnipeg. Devils 4, Senators 0:  Cory Schneider made 30 saves to earn his first shutout since November 2017 and host New Jersey won for the third time in four games. Hurricanes 4, Panthers 3:  Justin Williams had two goals and an assist and visiting Carolina rallied from a two-goal deficit to beat Florida, which won seven of its previous nine games. Wild 4, Rangers 1:  Zach Parise had a goal and an assist to help visiting Minnesota end a five-game skid. New York defenseman Adam McQuaid left in the first period because of an undisclosed injury. Canadiens 5, Flyers 1:  Brendan Gallagher recorded his first career hat trick as host Montreal won its second in a row. Oilers 4, Islanders 3:  Connor McDavid scored 1:22 into overtime as host Edmonton ended a five-game losing streak.

Briefly:  Washington acquired wing Carl Hagelin from Los Angeles for two draft picks. ... Nashville put forward Craig Smith on injured reserve because of a lower-body injury.After years of stagnation, the football helmet industry has welcomed some much-needed innovation. It’s been provided by Vicis, a Seattle-based company whose product debuted on the field last year and was named one of Time Magazine’s 25 best inventions of 2017. Founded in 2013, Vicis has provided hope that better-designed helmets could significantly reduce concussions. Dave Marver, who has a medical device background, formed the company with Dr. Sam Browd, a pediatric neurosurgeon, and Per Reinhall, an engineer who is a University of Washington professor. The inspiration for the company came from Browd, who had grown frustrated after advising teenagers they had to retire from contact sports due to head injuries. For years, mounting evidence has linked football violence with brain trauma and life-threatening conditions. Now that we know the sport can produce deadly results, where do we go from here? The Chronicle offers this special report on The Future of Football. Part 1: How is the NFL trying to make its game safer? Part 2: Youth football participation is a telling sign of things to come Part 3: What will the future of football really look like? Opinion: We know what needs to be done: But will we do it? “I don’t think a concussion-proof helmet is realistic,” Marver said. “But I do think helmet technology can continue to improve and we can potentially make football as safe as other sports so that kids can participate without undue concern.” Before the regular season, the NFL for the first time banned the use of 10 models of helmets that tested poorly. Now, of the league’s remaining 24 approved models, its two top-rated are the only two models that have been produced by Vicis. The Vicis Zero1 helmet features a softer shell that deforms on impact, reducing the force on a player’s head. The company was assisted by a grant of $1.1 million from the NFL. “None of us come from a traditional sporting-goods background, and so we’ve been able to approach things very differently and start with a clean sheet of paper,” Marver said. “And that kind of informed the design of the helmet as well, so we were we able to start from scratch without any legacy ideas. “And by deforming, it slows impact forces before they reach the head. And these are principles that you’ve seen in automotive safety for decades — the notion that bumpers and crumple zones better protect passengers so the car yields and slows those collision forces. Well, a helmet does the same thing.” Last year, about 75 players on 18 NFL teams used a Vicis helmet. This season, at least 150 players (about 9 percent of the NFL) representing 26 teams are wearing the helmet. Several prominent quarterbacks, including Washington’s Alex Smith, Seattle’s Russell Wilson and Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes, wear a Vicis. Hall of Famers Jerry Rice, Roger Staubach and Tony Dorsett serve as consultants to the company. The co-founders were surprised to find so little competition and innovation, particularly given the increased attention to head trauma in football in recent years. Riddell, Schutt and Zenith are the only other helmet manufacturers. Vicis’ $1.1 million grant came from the NFL’s Head Health Initiative, a four-year, $60 million collaboration designed to spur innovations around traumatic brain injuries. “They were seeking to fill a void that was there because the current helmet companies were not innovating,” Marver said. “We’re working to draw attention to the fact that helmet technology can improve. And we’re also, I think, catalyzing the rest of the industry to potentially do more.” There is also optimism that a concussion-sensing mouth guard will provide better understanding of the magnitude and frequency of impacts players experience, including lesser blows known as subconcussive hits. The NFL’s focus on concussion-inducing collisions hasn’t shed much light on these smaller impacts, often absorbed by linemen, that have been linked to brain trauma. Dr. Julian Bailes, a top expert on the long-term effects of brain trauma on NFL players, has advocated for the elimination of the three-point stance. Bailes believes it would limit the helmet-to-helmet collisions in the trenches that are an unavoidable part of football. Previous sensors, which were affixed to the back of helmets, did not produce reliable data, but Dr. Allen Sills, the NFL’s chief medical officer, thinks the mouth guard will be a “game-changer.” They are being used by the University of Virginia football team this season, with plans to have a limited rollout in the NFL in 2019. “What’s so revolutionary about these sensors is that, by being in the mouth, they will be much more centrally located,” Sills said. “And therefore a lot more reflective, we think, of what the brain is experiencing.”High school football players on 14 mostly Bay Area teams convene one Saturday in Pittsburg. They engage in the modern summer ritual of 7-on-7, a scaled-down version of the game featuring quarterbacks flinging passes and receivers trying to outmaneuver defenders. The players wear shorts and practice jerseys. Some don soft headgear, but what’s missing is notable: no linemen, no helmets or shoulder pads, no tackling. Less than three weeks later, in Houston, several former pro players — including onetime Cal running backs Jahvid Best and Justin Forsett — compete in the American Flag Football League final. NFL Network televises the game. Again: no linemen, no helmets or shoulder pads, no tackling. Is this what football will look like in the future? De La Salle’s Grant Daley is pursued by Antioch’s Ke’Sean Patton during a 7-on-7 tournament featuring 14 high school teams in Pittsburg this past summer. That might seem extreme, but envisioning how America’s most popular spectator sport will be played in 20 or 30 years carries complications. As participation at younger levels dips amid concerns about concussions and the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and as the pro and college games adopt rules changes intended to make an inherently violent sport safer, the future becomes murky. Participation in high school football in the U.S., which peaked in 2008, fell 6.9 percent by 2017, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), to 1,035,942. (Football still counted as the nation’s most popular boys sport by a wide margin.) The drop in California was even more severe: from a peak of 107,916 in 2006 to 94,286 in 2017, per the California Interscholastic Federation. That’s a decrease of 12.6 percent. Moreover, football players sustain more concussions than  other high school athletes, according to a 2017 study in the Journal of Athletic Training. That report, covering the 2011-12 through 2013-14 school years, found football players are 16 times more likely to suffer a concussion than baseball players, and four times more likely than male basketball players.

And the stakes are especially high for young athletes: A 2017 paper in the Annals of Neurology suggested a concussion in adolescence is associated with a greater risk of developing multiple sclerosis later in life. Also worth noting, the NFL experienced a 16.4 percent increase in concussions last season to 291, the league’s highest total since adopting its injury-tracking system in 2012. The NFL’s financial success (league revenue topped $14 billion last year), along with the huge sums of money tied to college football, suggests the game will remain eternally embedded in our culture, at least at the highest levels. But in what form? It’s an open and reasonable question, especially when taking the long-range view. Consider the near-abandonment of live tackling in practices; ejections for ferocious, once-celebrated, helmet-to-helmet hits; and radical changes to kickoffs designed to discourage returns. Those ideas would have been dismissed as blasphemy 20 or 30 years ago. De La Salle head coach Justin Alumbaugh offers his take on the evolution of football and what the game might look like 20 to 30 years from now. Now high school coaches such as Patrick Walsh of Serra-San Mateo strike a realistic tone. Walsh, who played at De La Salle-Concord in the early 1990s, loves football and wants it to prosper. He also recognizes the need to adapt. That’s why Walsh supports rules changes meant to minimize head injuries, and it also helps explain why he launched Next Level Flag Football, an ambitious program for kids ages 5 to 14. Its rapid growth since 2011, reaching nearly 30 sites and 1,500 participants this year, makes Walsh wonder what the future holds. “I can see this becoming a high school sport at some point,” he said. “I think at first it will be in addition (to tackle football), but who knows how far this will go 20 to 30 years from now? The game has changed so much in just the past 10 years.” The decades ahead promise even more change. Fast forward to 2048 and picture a game sharply different, in many ways, than what fans are accustomed to watching today.  Among the likely scenarios: • No kickoffs This probably will happen much sooner than 30 years, thanks in part to the Ivy League. The conference moved kickoffs to the 40-yard line in 2016 (from the 35), in an effort to reduce violent, high-speed collisions and limit the damage from kickoffs, which cause a disproportionate number of concussions. Kickoffs previously produced 23.4 percent of the Ivy League’s concussions, despite accounting for only 5.8 percent of all plays. In the first two seasons after the new rules took effect in conference games — including moving touchbacks (on kicks into the end zone) from the 25-yard line to the 20, and allowing receiving teams to make fair catches inside the 25 and get the ball at the 25 — kickoff returns and injury numbers plunged. (This year, the Ivy League is following a new NCAA rule placing touchbacks at the 25-yard line.) The league’s mean annual concussion rate per 1,000 kickoffs dropped from 10.93 before the changes (in 2013-15) to 2.04 after (2016-17), according to a study published Oct. 1 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.The number of  touchbacks increased from 17.9 percent in 2013-15 to 48 percent the past two seasons. “Our results are good now,” Ivy League executive director Robin Harris said, “but if we see more pooch kicks (intentionally short kicks), and players returning kicks from the 10-yard line, then I’m not as optimistic.” The NCAA tweaked its rules this season to permit fair catches inside the 25, while keeping kickoffs at the 35. The NFL also made changes aimed at reducing high-speed collisions. League officials have said kickoffs are four times more likely than other plays to result in concussions. Among the rule changes in response were eliminating players on the  kicking team from getting a 5-yard running start, as in the past (they now line up 1 yard behind the line); and allowing only three players on the receiving team to line up more than 15 yards downfield. So it requires no sixth sense to imagine the day, not far away, when football drops kickoffs altogether. “Kickoffs are close to being extinct,” said former 49ers quarterback Steve Young, now an ESPN analyst. Eye tracking sensors are seen inside a headset at SyncThink in Palo Alto on Aug. 3. The headset uses eye tracking to detect whether users might be concussed. • High-tech equipment For years, mounting evidence has linked football violence with brain trauma and life-threatening conditions. Now that we know the sport can produce deadly results, where do we go from here? Tuesday:  What will the future of football really look like? Online:  Read all the stories, watch videos, view photo slideshows and listen to our podcast on the subject at www.sfchronicle.com/future-of-football Do not be surprised if football players routinely wear helmet or mouth-guard sensors in the not-so-distant future, to detect and potentially prevent concussions. Pac-12 Conference schools already lean on technological advances in equipment. The conference announced in November 2017 its partnership with SyncThink, a Palo Alto company that uses an eye-tracking system to quickly gather data on the sideline. That could become a tool in helping trainers and doctors objectively determine when a player has sustained a concussion. SyncThink’s Eye-Sync device, essentially virtual-reality goggles to analyze eye movements and identify visual impairment, received FDA approval. But the agency also raised questions last year about using Eye-Sync to assess possible head trauma, telling the company to stop marketing the device in this way. Mouth-guard sensors are another potential path to acquiring information about concussions and sub-concussive hits. Four high school programs in Florida are testing one version of a mouth-guard sensor this season, as is the University of Virginia. The NFL plans a limited rollout in 2019. David Camarillo, an assistant professor of bioengineering at Stanford, launched research in this area in 2011. Camarillo said mouth-guard sensors, which fit tightly along  the upper teeth and take a precise measurement of what is happening to the  skull, can help researchers understand the forces associated with concussions. That  could lead to improved helmet standards, for instance. Camarillo cautioned that there’s not yet enough scientific evidence for clinical decision-making. Still, the NFL hopes position-specific helmets — individually tailored to the force typically absorbed by, say, linebackers or wide receivers — will become available as soon as 2020. Players at each position experience different impacts, an NFL study showed, and helmets potentially can be designed to minimize those impacts, according to a spokesman for Vicis, a Seattle equipment company. For example, defensive players often knock quarterbacks backward. That leads to the back of quarterbacks’ helmets striking the turf; in theory, quarterback helmets can be designed to better absorb these blows. Sam Browd, co-founder of Vicis,  also sees helmets ultimately including a computer chip serving as a mobile lab. “Helmets will be used to track players’ performance: gauge their speed, maneuverability and a variety of factors,” Browd said. “Maybe you can sense someone who will be dehydrated. The helmet will be the platform to embed various technologies.” This summer, the Visalia Unified School District became the nation’s first to fully equip its varsity players with Vicis’ signature model, the Zero1. The helmet’s soft exterior bends on impact to better absorb the force of hits, with the hard layer (to protect the skull) moved inside. Zero1 ranked No. 1 in safety testing done at Virginia Tech, but it remains unproven how effectively new equipment reduces head injuries. About 150 players on 26 NFL teams are using Vicis helmets this season, including nine 49ers and more than 20 members of the Kansas City Chiefs, most notably quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Joshua Knox, 10, performs a drill with a Shadowman tackling dummy as coaches and kids from Coyote Creek Youth Sports attend a tackling demonstration by Shadowman Sports at Yerba Buena High School in San Jose on Aug. 27. • Smart tackling Former Stanford running back Kerry Carter recalled the way coaches once taught tackling: Lower your head and ram it between the numbers on the opposing player’s chest.  That method was simple, emphatic and, it turns out, stupid. Carter now is vice president of football operations at Atavus Sports, another Seattle company that provides “tackling analysis” to high school and college programs including Ohio State, Washington and San Jose State. Atavus conducted a three-day session in July for the Texas High School Coaches Association, its first alliance with a prep football governing body. The essential message: Tackle rugby-style, shoulder first. “We focus on changing the behavior,” Carter said. “I love the game and don’t want to see it go anywhere, but there needs to be a shift in the culture.” Pete Carroll, head coach of the NFL’s Seattle Seahawks, advocates a similar technique in his Seahawk Tackling Video, which has become a widely used tool among high school coaches (including De La Salle’s Justin Alumbaugh). Another novelty likely to become common is the mobile, robotic tackling dummy pioneered at Dartmouth. This futuristic, remote-controlled invention, self-righting and practical, darts around the field with striking speed. Players work on tackling techniques without hitting each other, reducing exposure to injuries. This helped convince Ivy League coaches to eliminate live tackling in practices. That’s a potentially vital piece of the puzzle, because one Johns Hopkins University report noted that 62 percent of organized sports-related injuries occur during practice. 49ers quarterback Steve Young suffered a concussion against the Arizona Cardinals on Sept. 27, 1999, that ended his career. • Athletic migration Young, the Hall of Fame quarterback whose career ended after a vicious hit and concussion in September 1999, predicted scientific advances on CTE will reshape the sport. Players might one day know, as Young suggested, exactly how much football could shorten their life span. “Football will be hugely impacted by what CTE looks like in 10 to 15 years,” he said. As it stands, the disease looks more ominous than it did even two years ago. In July 2017, an American Medical Association study found 110 of 111 brains of deceased former NFL players had CTE. More news like this in the years ahead could further discourage parents from permitting their kids to play football, thinning the talent pool. And the pool already has shrunk, as Young pointed out. “Most superior athletes played football in the 1950s through the ’90s,” he said. “But now it’s in parents’ minds that football is not safe, and therefore kids pick up other sports. That trend is not stopping, and it has to have an effect over a period of time.” Why fewer kids are playing football: A study in decline And that was barely 20 years ago. Now when Alumbaugh gazes into the future, he pictures the effect of flag football and 7-on-7.  De La Salle played in three such tournaments this past summer (essentially touch football), plus another six games against local opponents. “The game will look a lot different in 20 or 30 years,” Alumbaugh said. “I’m not going to say it will be 7-on-7, because there will still be linemen, but I think that’s where a lot of kids’ skills will be. That’s what they’ll grow up doing.” Walsh similarly sees value in 7-on-7, though he insisted the absence of running plays and a pass rush mean “it’s not even close to being football.” He also endorsed high school reforms limiting contact in practice and requiring severe punishment on hits to defenseless players. Walsh would have been called “soft” for taking this view in his playing days, but that era is long gone. If coaches don’t change with the times, football in 2048 might bear little resemblance to its current incarnation. “If we’d like this game to exist in 30 years,” Walsh said, “then all of us need to get on board.” Ron Kroichick is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email:  rkroichick@sfchronicle.com  Twitter:  @ronkroichickA teammate calls her “LBJ” — initials for “LeBron James Jr.” It’s not an outlandish nickname, given that Natalie Diaz is sort of like King James on the NCAA Division II level of women’s basketball. For most of the season, she has led the nation in all NCAA divisions in scoring, although now she’s third in Division II at 26 points per game. That’s the best average of any women’s college player in the Bay Area. At Dominican University in San Rafael, the prolific senior is listed as a 6-foot guard. Actually, she’s mainly a post player, and head coach Tim LaKose says she “might be 5-11 depending on what shoes she’s wearing.” Diaz has led the Penguins — named for the Dominican nuns who used to run the school — to a 19-3 record, including a 16-2 mark in the Pacific West Conference. They’re in second place behind Azusa Pacific (19-4,16-1) going into Saturday’s home game against Fresno Pacific. Who:  Fresno Pacific (16-8, 12-6 Pacific West) at Dominican (19-3, 16-2) Where:  Conlan Center, San Rafael When:  2 p.m. The conference tournament is March 7-9 at Dominican’s Conlan Center, and Diaz and her teammates would love to give the school its first title in any sport since it moved from the NAIA to the NCAA Division II nine years ago. The conference should get at least two berths in the NCAA Division II tournament. Diaz, already the school’s all-time leading scorer, had 41 and 37 points in back-to-back games early in the season. She also averages 8.9 rebounds, fourth in the league. “She’s a once-in-a-lifetime kind of player, a coach’s dream, really, for how hard she works,” said LaKose, a former San Jose State women’s head coach. “Her attitude is contagious. She expects that of others.” She was a standout at Soquel High, but she got on Dominican’s radar while playing for the Palo Alto Midnight AAU team. The first time LaKose saw her in action, he was struck by what he calls her “wow factor.” He quickly surveyed the onlookers during a tournament at Foothill College to see if any other college coaches were on hand. Diaz had never heard of Dominican, but she and her father decided to pay an unofficial visit on their way back from a trip to Sonoma State. She later paid an official visit and fell in love with the school and the basketball program. For one thing, she liked the 10:1 faculty-student ratio and the undergraduate enrollment of just 1,355. Counting grad students, it’s 1,783. Some Division I schools came after her, but they couldn’t promise her what she wanted most: minutes and plenty of them. Last season, Dominican was poised for big things until its other standout, Sandra Ikeora, wrecked an ankle and missed most of the season. “When Sandy got hurt, Nat really needed by necessity to step up and lead the team,” LaKose said. “She realized how dominant she could be.” The Penguins lost in the semifinals of the conference tournament, and Diaz considered it a missed opportunity. At the start of this season, LaKose asked each player to pick a word to describe her attitude. Diaz chose “killer.” He said, “She had that kind of mentality. She saw you’ve got to have that to get to the next spot. If you don’t, it’s probably not going to happen.” Diaz gets most of her points in the paint, driving with either hand. She hits 48 percent of her shots overall, but when she steps behind the 3-point arc, her accuracy climbs to 57 percent in limited tries (20-for-35). The team needs her more down low, and teammate Alanna Scott ranks 31st in the nation from distance at 41 percent (62-for-153). “When teams double- or triple-team me, I’m always looking out for the shooters,” Diaz said. “Anybody on the team can knock it down.” She admires Elena Delle Donne of the WNBA’s Washington Mystics for her all-around skills and NBA great Tim Duncan for his coolness and extraordinary fundamentals. “There’s something special about classic basketball,” Diaz said. “I really loved the way Tim Duncan played.”How can George Kittle improve on his record-breaking season? Kyle Shanahan gave the 49ers tight end an answer: Kittle can make strides as a route runner. During a recent 30-minute phone interview  for this story , Kittle addressed Shanahan’s offseason improvement plan for him. “Coach Shanahan said that out of all the tight ends he’s ever had, I do a lot of things really, really well,” Kittle said. “But I’m still third (among that group) in route running. So that’s one of the challenges he gave to me. And that’s certainly one thing I’ll focus on this offseason.” Kittle’s 2018 season included 88 catches for 1,377 yards, the most yards by a tight end in NFL history. However, Kittle pointed to a catch he didn’t make - because of a poor route he ran - to illustrate where he can improve. In the 49ers’ 33-30 loss at Green Bay in October, quarterback C.J. Beathard threw a late-game interception to set up the Packers’ game-winning drive. Beathard’s pick came in a 3rd-and-3 situation when Green Bay brought an all-out blitz. Beathard hurled a deep pass to Marquise Goodwin that was intercepted by Kevin King. “When C.J. threw the interception at the end of the game, Shanahan was more mad at me for my route,” Kittle said. “It was (3rd-and-3) and I had a five-yard stick route. I ran it at four yards. He told me ‘Hey, just run it at two (yards). It’s a zero blitz. You probably would have caught it and run for 15 yards.’ So that’s the type of stuff he sees and -- in the back of my head -- I don’t even realize it until he tells me.” Shanahan coached three tight ends who went to at least one Pro Bowl during their career in his nine seasons as an offensive coordinator: Houston’s Owen Daniels, Washington’s Chris Cooley and Cleveland’s Jordan Cameron. That trio could be included on Kittle’s offseason video stream. “Luckily, I have a great film staff and they hook my iPad up with all the film of every tight end in the NFL this year,” Kittle said. “Plus there’s some guys from old Shanahan tapes. So I’ll be able to watch their stuff and hopefully pick up a couple things that I can add to my game.” Starry eyed:  Kittle has developed friendships with a group of NFL players this offseason that includes Vikings wide receiver Adam Thielen and Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan. Those connections were first made at the Pro Bowl in Orlando, where Kittle made his first appearance in the all-star game. “On the first night we had a mandatory meeting at 7 p.m. so I walked downstairs and the first person I saw was (Broncos pass-rusher) Von Miller and he said what’s up,” Kittle said. “I was just kind of bouncing back and forth between guys and it was kind of like ‘Holy cow, there are some - there a lot of superstars in here.’ Just a lot of guys I’ve watched my entire life. “I walked in with (Ravens guard) Marshal Yanda, who also played at Iowa. He’s got 12 years on me. Seeing guys like that just makes you appreciate where you’re at and the opportunity that I had.” Chip off old block:   Kittle’s dad, Bruce, was an offensive tackle at Iowa, who was a co-captain on their 1981 Rose Bowl team . So George made sure to tell his dad about an exchange he overheard at his first Pro Bowl practice. “There were a couple defensive linemen and they were talking about how tight ends don’t block,” Kittle said. “But one guy said ‘Well, unless you’re Kittle because he’ll put his hands on you’. I appreciate that because if known for that, I’m OK. I’m up for the physicality.” Bland answer on Brown:  Kittle caused a minor stir on Dec. 31 by  connecting with disgruntled Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown on Twitter . As a result, he fielded an endless array of questions about Brown during his parade of interviews on radio row during Super Bowl week in Atlanta. Kittle acknowledged he quickly developed a stock response: “Yeah, you know what’s coming: So it’s ‘Hey, you need to talk to Mr. Lynch and coach Shanahan. I stand behind their decisions.”PEORIA, Ariz. - The rains cleared on Friday, giving Jesus Luzardo the opportunity to air it out against six batters on a chilly afternoon in the desert. “It was cold,” Luzardo said, “but I heard it’s cold in Oakland, so I kind of gotta get used to it.” Yes, he does. But when will he begin pitching in the elements of the Coliseum? It’s one of the biggest questions in camp. Luzardo, the A’s top prospect, cruised through most of last season in the minors and is on the verge of breaking into the big leagues, but the A’s are being careful with the 21-year-old lefty. Adding to the equation is the shortened Arizona portion of spring training. The A’s need to make some decisions in a hurry because they’re leaving for Tokyo on March 14 for regular-season games March 20 and 21 against the Mariners. Mariners 8, A’s 1 Notable: Starter Daniel Mengden trailed 2-0 after two batters. Dee Gordon walked, and Mitch Haniger homered. ... J.B. Wendelken had the roughest day among the pitchers, giving up three runs in two-thirds of an inning ... The A’s scored their run when Sean Murphy, their best catching prospect, hit a monster homer in the ninth inning. ...Ichiro Suzuki, 45, was 1-for-2 , including a two-run single off Ryan Buchter. After his third-inning hit, he was replaced by a pinch-runner. As he walked off the field between innings, he happened by the A’s dugout to shake the hand of Bob Melvin, his former manager in Seattle. Quotable:  “(Mark) Canha was talking about it. The first-base umpire was saying it’s a clock violation when I was cleaning my cleats off. Well, I’m cleaning my cleats. Clearly, there’s time. He was trying to yell at the home-plate umpire, Canha was saying. If they want to do a pitch clock, that’s fine. Most guys will be OK with it.” Saturday’s game:  White Sox at A’s, 12:05 p.m. The question is whether Luzardo will get enough opportunities to make the A’s feel comfortable about keeping him once they resume their season at the Coliseum on March 28. “It’s going to be tough. We’re piggybacking guys now,” said manager Bob Melvin, explaining multiple starters will be used on some days to have them ready earlier. Luzardo made his Cactus League debut by pitching the fourth inning in Friday’s 8-1 loss to the Mariners. He wasn’t particularly sharp — neither was the defense behind him — but touched 97 mph and said he felt good with his highly touted repertoire. “You can tell there’s more of a hurry for everyone to get their innings in because there are fewer days, and we can’t afford rainouts,” said Luzardo, who gave up an unearned run and two hits and issued a walk. “We’re not getting rushed or anything like that. Everything’s going smoothly.” Luzardo dominated last year at Class A Stockton (1.23 ERA in three starts) and Double-A Midland (2.29 in 16 starts) but not at Triple-A Nashville (7.31 in four starts), so that could be his season-opening destination. He reiterated he doesn’t think he needs to prove anything to the A’s, a mind-set he uses to lessen the pressure. “I’m going to do what I know I can do,” Luzardo said. “If they like me, they like me. I don’t feel I need to prove anything to anyone. I’m going out there and getting my work in.” While Luzardo is known for three pitches — fastball, breaking ball, changeup — he noted it’s actually five because he throws two variations of a fastball (four-seam and two-seam) and two breaking balls (curve and slurve). To convince the A’s he’s a big-leaguer, he must master his fastball command. “We just have to feel like he’s ready to do it and confident in doing it,” Melvin said. “When he gets here, we want him to be able to stay. We don’t want to feel like there’s some vulnerability, and we might have to send him down at some point. “I haven’t seen anything in his demeanor that there’s some vulnerability at this point.” Briefly:  Third baseman Matt Chapman is on target to appear in a game early next week. He has been slow-played because he’s coming off left shoulder surgery. ... The A’s anticipate platooning their catchers, meaning lefty-swinging Chris Herrmann is a favorite to make the team. The right-handed hitters are Josh Phegley, who’s out of options, and former Giant Nick Hundley, who signed a minor-league contract. “We envision Herrmann being one of the guys,” Melvin said. “We do like the platoon situation, as I’m sitting here now. It’s why we signed him. Things change along the way in spring training and during the season, but we brought him in to give him a pretty good opportunity.”Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim struck and killed a man along an interstate late Wednesday as Boeheim was trying to avoid hitting the man’s disabled vehicle, Syracuse, N.Y., police said. Police said Jorge Jimenez, 51, was with three others in a vehicle that skidded on a patch of ice and hit a guardrail before coming to a halt on I-690 in Syracuse. Boeheim’s car struck Jimenez — who had been heading toward the median for safety — as Boeheim was trying to avoid the disabled car, officials said. “I am heartbroken that a member of our community died as the result of last night’s accident,” Boeheim, 74, said in a statement. He and his wife Juli “extend our deepest sympathies to the Jimenez family.” Police said Boeheim has been cooperating with the investigation and that he used his cell-phone light to warn other drivers of the disabled car after the accident. “At this time, we have no reason to believe that there are criminal charges that will be coming for anyone,” Syracuse Police Chief Kenton Buckner said. Hours before the accident, Boeheim’s team defeated 18th-ranked Louisville 69-49. Williamson day to day:  Duke forward Zion Williamson, who left the Blue Devils’ game against North Carolina in the first minute Wednesday after tweaking his right knee when his shoe ripped apart, is day to day with a mild knee sprain, a team official said. Nike, which supplied Williamson’s shoes, felt the impact of the incident as its stock fell 89 cents Thursday to $83.95, about a 1 percent drop. “I’ve seen guys bust through shoes but not sprain their knee,” Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski said. “He goes so fast that maybe if there’s something slippery, that happened.” Thursday’s games  Gonzaga rolls Rui Hachimura scored 23 points as No. 2 Gonzaga beat visiting Pepperdine 92-64. Zach Norvell Jr. added 21 points and Brandon Clarke had 16 points, 11 rebounds and five blocks for the Bulldogs (26-2, 13-0 WCC), whose 17-game winning streak is the longest in the nation.

Neibel, as one of several changes to their coaching staff, a team source confirmed Sunday. Neibel assumes a role that had been vacant since the Raiders fired Tom Shaw in December. ESPN first reported the hiring Sunday. The Raiders finished last season with 18 players on injured reserve. Head coach Jon Gruden, though, termed Shaw’s departure in December after less than a season a “personal matter.” Neibel spent the last two seasons as an athletic performance specialist with the Jaguars. He previously worked with the Raiders from 2003-08 as a strength and conditioning/sports medicine associate, and also worked on the training staffs of the Falcons and San Francisco Giants. The Raiders still have multiple position coaching vacancies to fill. Running backs coach Jemal Singleton is leaving after one season with Oakland to join the Bengals’ coaching staff, a source said. The Raiders also earlier this offseason lost quarterbacks coach Brian Callahan to Cincinnati, where he is the new offensive coordinator. Defensive backs coach Derrick Ansley, meanwhile, has left to join the coaching staff at University of Tennessee. Ansley coached at University of Alabama before coaching the Raiders’ defensive backs for one season. Mike Trgovac, who spent one season as defensive line coach, is now a senior assistant with the Raiders, who  hired former 49ers and Panthers defensive lineman Brentson Buckner  as a replacement.Former Warriors head coach Don Nelson is spending his retirement on Maui enjoying all the island has to offer. \"I’ve been smoking some pot, but I never smoked when I played or coached,\" Nelson said when asked how he’s been keeping busy. \"It’s new to me. I’m doing that. It’s more legal now than it’s ever been, so I’m enjoying that.\" Nelson, 78, was on hand at Oracle Arena with former players Jason Richardson and Stephen Jackson to be honored for his part on the 2006-07 \"We Believe\" team that became the first No. 8 seed in NBA history to outlast a No. 1 seed in a seven-game series. In the nine years since he last coached, Nelson has changed his look a bit. His white hair tied back into a pony tail, he arrived to the arena wearing a gold chain, a black shirt and a black suit. After conceding that he was smoking his share of marijuana, Nelson said that he’s been renting out his property and is making a \"good living.\" If Nelson runs low on cannabis, he can phone Jackson, who helps run a cannabis brand called Viola Extracts with ex-Golden State teammate Al Harrington. \"I need to bring you some Nellie Kush,\" Jackson said.MESA, Ariz. — A year after Jonathan Lucroy handled most of the catching duties for the A’s, they have three catchers vying for two spots with Chris Herrmann likely making the team as the only left-handed hitter in the group. The right-handed hitters are Josh Phegley and former Giant Nick Hundley. “We feel good about all three guys,” manager Bob Melvin said Friday before the team’s trip to Peoria for an exhibition with the Mariners. “Chances are, we go with two.” Herrmann, 31, signed with the A’s as a free agent on Dec. 11 after playing the past seven seasons with the Twins, Diamondbacks and Mariners. He’s a .205 career hitter with a .282 on-base percentage and batted .237 in 36 games last year in Seattle. He played a career-high 106 games for the 2017 Diamondbacks, and Arizona’s pitchers posted a 3.17 ERA when he was behind the plate, lowest in the majors among catchers with at least 40 innings. “We envision Herrmann being one of the guys,” Melvin said. “We do like the platoon situation, as I’m sitting here now. It’s why we signed him. Things change along the way in spring training and during the season, but we brought him in to give him a pretty good opportunity.” Phegley, 31, is a .223 career hitter who has been on the injured list five times the past three years. He’s out of options so a team could snag him if the A’s tried to send him to Triple-A Nashville. “He does a great job behind the plate with throwing and blocking, a lot of intangible stuff,” Melvin said. “The bat at times came along, and you look at the games he caught last year, we won a lot of those games. What I hope he does is not worry about anybody else, just worry about yourself and see what you could do. He’s going to get a pretty good opportunity.” Hundley, 35, signed a minor-league contract Feb. 19 after spending two years with the Giants, backing up Buster Posey and hitting 19 homers. His career average is .241.Cal head women’s basketball coach Lindsay Gottlieb reached out to Carol Christ and asked the university’s chancellor if she would come to Saturday’s game against No. 1 Connecticut as the Bears’ honorary coach. Christ had to decline the special treatment. She already had tickets and plans to sit with the fans. “You can pretend like you care, but you can’t fake showing up,” said Gottlieb, who worked closely with Christ on the athletic director hiring committee this year. “As someone who watches other leaders and tries to learn, she’s someone I’ve taken interest in. If there’s some sort of report card on her first year and a half that asks about her commitment to excellence in athletics, she’s off the charts. “She’s committed to the issues surrounding athletics, to being successful and to everything at Cal being at a high level. I’ve been wildly impressed.” A lifelong academic, who describes her core as an English professor fond of reading and talking about books, Christ might not be the first name to spring to mind when considering sports influencers. She joined Cal’s faculty in 1970 and held a series of high-ranking positions in Berkeley before being named the president of Smith College in 2002. She returned to Berkeley as the provost in 2016 and took over as the school’s first woman chancellor in May 2017 — a move she’s used thoughtfully to put her fingerprints all over the Cal athletics department. “There’s been a big gap between the campus and athletics for a number of years, but I’ve seen a real change among some of the faculty that either ignored athletics or looked down their noses at it,” said Bill Ausfahl, a Cal graduate who retired as a group vice president and CFO of the Clorox Company. “Their attitudes have changed, largely because of Carol.” Ausfahl chaired the initial fundraising for the Memorial Stadium renovations and is now working on the capital campaign to upgrade facilities for softball and women’s beach volleyball. He said Christ is the first chancellor to  speak to the student-athletes at the Big C Society’s welcome back barbecue and the first to  give the athletic director a seat in cabinet meetings. Christ is a regular at Cal football games, but she doesn’t just hide in the chancellor’s suite. She strolls the plaza without an aide and meets fans and marches to the front of the students’ section and leads cheers. “This is all symbolic of the relationship that is now evolving between the university and athletics,” Ausfahl said. “It’s setting a precedent that has invaluable rewards.” Oddly enough, Christ isn’t necessarily a sports fan. She tried basketball as a child, though she describes her play as neither “good” nor “enthusiastic.” She tried to be supportive of her late husband’s love of sports and gained an understanding of athletics’ positive impact in watching her stepson, who danced for the Joffrey Ballet and now runs his own dance company. Instead of being tilted by fandom, Christ has taken an informed, objective, problem-solving approach to  the mammoth challenges in Berkeley. She has mandated that the athletics department have a balanced budget by 2020 and transition to Prong 1 of Title IX compliance by 2021. “I’m at the point in my career that I am, which is twice retired already, I feel a shortness and urgency of time,” Christ said. “One way that I manage is to set aggressive deadlines with my senior staff. I think that works well. We don’t always meet them, but you certainly don’t meet them if you don’t set them.” She jokes that there have been more comprehensive reports on Cal athletics problems than Rose Bowl appearances, but she believes she sees a way forward. With cutting sports as a last resort, Christ said she is close to agreeing with athletic director Jim Knowlton on a budget and the size and scope of the department — with an expected announcement this spring. Hiring Knowlton in April might have been Christ’s best move in 2018, but she also took on the seismic portion of the Memorial Stadium debt that was strangling the athletic department and has seemingly done the impossible in starting to unify the campus and the sports programs. “I think she recognizes the importance of sport and what it does for the student-athletes and what it can do for the university, alumni and city,” head football coach Justin Wilcox said. “She’s a really impressive person. She knows that you can galvanize people through athletics. It can be a gateway. The university and the athletic department can live in harmony.” On Oct. 27, Christ stayed long after the final whistle in the Cal football team’s 12-10 win over then-No. 15 Washington. She saw families, children, athletes and students milling around the field in postgame bliss. The scene swept her back a month to the Greek Theatre, where she attended a Yo-Yo Ma concert. “At the conclusion, 6,000 people rose, as if they were one person,” Christ said. “There was such a feeling of being part of something much larger than you. We don’t have that many occasions in our lives when we feel part of a communal identity. “Sports is one of the things that gives us that.” As the clock winds down on 2018, The Chronicle profiles 10 influencers who will shape the Bay Area sports landscape in 2019.San Francisco’s Olympic Club landed another national championship Thursday. The USGA announced  sites for the U.S. Amateur, including the Olympic Club in 2025. This will be the fourth time Olympic has hosted the Amateur, and the first time since 2007. Thursday’s news is especially notable in light of the  Olympic Club’s agreement  in November 2017 to hold the PGA Championship (in 2028) and Ryder Cup (in 2032). The PGA of America runs those events,  competing with the USGA  for prestigious venues on which to hold their marquee tournaments. Olympic, which has hosted five U.S. Opens — most recently in 2012, when Webb Simpson won — essentially switched sides after negotiations for a sixth Open broke down. But this announcement of another U.S. Amateur on the horizon marks a clear step in the thawing of tensions between Olympic Club and USGA officials. Olympic’s Lake Course also will host the  U.S. Women’s Open in 2021 . “I wouldn’t say this ‘fixes’ our relationship,” Olympic Club general manager Pat Finlen said. “We’ve always had a great relationship with the USGA, and this is just another positive step. While we’re not hosting an Open for the next 10 to 12 years, we’re excited to host an Amateur. It just reinforces our relationship.” The club’s three previous U.S. Amateurs were played in 1958, 1981 and 2007. Charles Coe won in ’58, Nathaniel Crosby (Bing’s son) won in ’81 and Colt Knost defeated Michael Thompson in the ’07 title match. Olympic has a rich tradition of sponsoring amateur sports, dating to the club’s inception in 1860. It currently fields 19 different amateur teams in various sports. “We’re an athletic club, not a golf club,” Finlen said. “When members think about the Olympic Club, they think about amateur sports. This (event) fits the club so well.” Northern California is set to host many big golf tournaments in the coming years, starting with the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach in June. Also on tap: the PGA Championship at Harding Park in May 2020; the Women’s Open at Olympic in June 2021; the Women’s Open at Pebble Beach in ’23; and the Presidents Cup at Harding Park, Walker Cup at Cypress Point and now U.S. Amateur at Olympic Club in ’25.SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — The advantage of managing a team in flux is not having to worry about finding at least four regulars or platoon players to send on the road for exhibition games. That could be almost anybody on Team Versatility. None of the big boys will be on the field for the Giants on Saturday when they open the Cactus League against the Angels at Tempe Diablo Stadium, but the lineup will feature a host of guys who could start games in the regular season. Mac Williamson , coming off his concussion-ruined season, will play left field and bat fourth. Two of the just-signed veterans,  Cameron Maybin  and  Yangervis Solarte , will bat first and third, respectively, playing right field and third base. Aramis Garcia  will catch, with Rule 5 outfielder  Drew Ferguson  getting an early look in center. Maybin and Solarte seem eager to get rolling for a team they did not  join until last week. “They said they’re good to go and they want to play,” manager  Bruce Bochy  said. Others in the lineup are  Abiatal Avelino  at short,  Austin Slater  at first,  Henry Ramos  ( Heliot ’s older brother) as the designated hitter, minor-league invite  Donovan Solano  at second and  Chris Stratton  on the mound for about 25 pitches. Bochy said the Giants foresee Stratton in a similar swing role as last year. One of the pitchers expected to throw behind him Saturday is  Ty Blach , who was a jack of all trades last year — long relief, short relief and starting. Blach will be stretched out as a starter this spring. “You saw what happened last year,” Bochy said. “He was our Opening Day starter. You want to keep that flexibility so if anything happens, he’s ready to go.” Who:  Giants vs. Angels Where:  Tempe Diablo Stadium Time:  Noon  Radio:  680 The Giants will start some of their regulars in Sunday’s home opener against the Cubs, with  Madison Bumgarner  pitching,  Evan Longoria  and  Brandon Belt  at their regular positions and  Brandon Crawford  as DH. Buster Posey ,  Steven Duggar  and  Ryder Jones  are not expected to play until at least Friday. They are being eased in after their respective surgeries. Roster madness:  If you can follow this, take a 40-man spot out of petty cash. On Feb. 12, the Giants designated reliever  Josh Osich  for assignment to clear a 40-man spot for starter  Jose Lopez , whom they claimed off waivers from the Reds. The Orioles claimed Osich and opened a 40-man spot for him by  designating infielder  Hanser Alberto , who on Friday was claimed by ... The Giants. So, San Francisco and Baltimore essentially traded Osich for Alberto, a 26-year-old who has been in the minors for eight seasons. The Giants needed a 40-man spot for Alberto, of course, so former Arizona reliever  Jake Barrett  was designated for assignment. The Giants had acquired Barrett in a Feb. 5 trade after the Diamondbacks — wait for it — designated him for assignment. The moral: If you even   you are viewed as the 40th man on a team’s roster, get luggage with sturdy wheels.Rich Gannon, the 17-year NFL quarterback and current analyst for CBS, said he sees a common thread among teams that have achieved sustained success in the league. “You talk to any coach that’s lasted a long time,” Gannon said, “it’s all about the locker room — the quality and the character and integrity and toughness of your locker room.” When Gannon joined the Raiders in 1999, he said, he found those characteristics lacking. But he also found the team in a state of transition entering its second season under head coach Jon Gruden — who concludes his first season back at the helm Sunday in Kansas City. “It was a bad locker room” in 1999, Gannon said. “There were guys that didn’t love football, guys that were just there for the wrong reasons or just immature. It was really bad. And then eventually, we got rid of some of those players. Eventually, we weeded them all out. “I’m not suggesting that locker room is full of bad people right now. Some of them just aren’t talented enough. But it’s a process of bringing in the right type of player that fits your system but is also the right type of person. That’s really important.” The Raiders will cap a year of organizational turnover with a last-place finish in the AFC West. Gruden, re-introduced as coach  Jan. 9, brought with him a handpicked coaching staff. The Raiders spent spring overhauling their roster — and then continued the process well into the season. Of the 53 players on the Raiders’ active roster in Week 15 against the Bengals, 16 had played in a game for them in 2017. Of the 50 players the Raiders drafted from 2012 through ’17 — Reggie McKenzie’s first six drafts as general manager — only eight remain on the active roster. On Dec. 10, McKenzie, the 2016 NFL Executive of the Year, was let go in a move that was widely portrayed as a consolidation of Gruden’s power. In announcing the parting — which Gruden said happened in his absence — the Raiders said they would begin looking for a new “front office executive,” not necessarily a GM, an ambiguity not lost on analysts. ESPN reporter Adam Schefter cast McKenzie’s firing as a sign the Raiders are “Gruden’s ship — and he’s going to run it.” NFL Network counterpart Ian Rapoport described the front-office job as one where “you don’t have final say — you really are just scouting for what Gruden wants.” On Dec. 10, Gruden was asked whether he expected to be involved in the interview process for the executive and replied: “Don’t know. Don’t know.” He was more forthcoming when asked if he hopes to have input in the Raiders’ 2019 draft. “I think any coach wants input,” Gruden said. “I’ve had input here. I had input on the draft picks that we made when I was here with Al Davis. I had some input on the draft this year. And I think it’s a collaboration around the league.” And it is here, beyond coaching and offensive play-calling, that Gruden’s influence might be felt strongest in 2019 and for years to come — Gruden reportedly signed a 10-year, $100 million deal to return to the sidelines. Gruden, along with owner Mark Davis, certainly will be involved in hiring the executive who will help him acquire players. He certainly will have a voice, perhaps the loudest, in a draft in which the Raiders have three first-round picks. As he seeks to “rebuild” the Raiders — to mold the locker room as Gannon remembered — Gruden’s input into decisions made in the coming months figure to reverberate for the rest of his tenure. Gruden’s effectiveness as a personnel man has been spotty. During his seven seasons as head coach in Tampa Bay, the Buccaneers drafted 61 players — three of whom eventually made the Pro Bowl. The Raiders’ use of the 15th overall pick this year on  tackle Kolton Miller was viewed as a reach by some; Miller has played inconsistently while dealing with a knee injury. Among the players still available at No. 15 in April was safety Derwin James, who has become a favorite for NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year with the Chargers. Oddly, before a game against the Chargers in October, Gruden told Los Angeles media on a conference call that he’d wanted James but passed in part because the Raiders spent high picks on safeties in the previous two drafts. Through his first season back in coaching, Gruden seemed to retain some of his analyst persona from years at ESPN. He punctuated media sessions with quips, even after losses, and comments that at times seemed self-defeating, such as when he was asked about finding pass-rushers less than three weeks after the Raiders dealt Khalil Mack to Chicago and answered: “It’s hard to find a great one. It’s hard to find a good one.” He often interrupted answers to directly address fans, sometimes looking straight into cameras, offering thanks or asking for patience amid the team’s struggles. After the Raiders traded Amari Cooper to Dallas in October, Gruden offered a broad and vague explanation to reporters. “We’re doing everything we can to win games and certainly build this football team,” he said. “Not everybody, I’m sure, understands what is going on. I just want to say those two things: We’re doing everything we can for the Raiders, for the team today and the team of the future.” In a moment of sync, McKenzie, after the Raiders landed a first-round pick in the Cooper trade, said he also saw the organization headed in a positive direction. “This is where we get a great opportunity to build,” McKenzie said. “We’ve got pieces now. But we can really build on what we have. And with this group of coaches that I got here, now we know where we’re headed schematically on both sides of the ball, on special teams. And we’re going to build this thing, I think. We’ve got the ammunition to build this thing really well here.” McKenzie’s folly, in this case, was his use of the pronoun “I.” The Raiders, for the time being, appear to be Gruden’s show. To be seen is how successfully he’ll run it. As the clock winds down on 2018, The Chronicle profiles 10 influencers who will shape the Bay Area sports landscape in 2019. How the Raiders fared in each of Jon Gruden’s first seasons (NFL rankings): Stat 1998 2018 Record 8-8 4-11 Points scored per game 18.0 (22) 19.1 (28) Points allowed per game 22.2 (20) 28.8 (31) Rushing yards per game 107.9 (16) 100.1 (26) Passing yards per game 193.0 (21) 239.1 (16) Total yards per game 300.9 (18) 339.1 (22) Rushing yards allowed per game 104.6 (15) 143.3 (30) Passing yards allowed per game 179.7 (4) 236.2 (14) Total yards allowed per game 284.4 (5) 379.5 (25)The first scene in Josh Begley’s short film makes it clear it won’t be a standard montage of helmet-rattling NFL collisions. “Concussion Protocol” opens with a close-up shot of Broncos wide receiver Bennie Fowler III,  his helmet off, in the moments after he sustained a concussion. Fowler’s faraway look is apparent to viewers, who will spend over five minutes being provoked and pained rather than entertained. “I didn’t want it to be a highlight reel of hard hits because those exist, and because those are very difficult to watch,” Begley said. “And in some ways, I feel like watching them desensitizes me more to what I’m seeing.” For years, mounting evidence has linked football violence with brain trauma and life-threatening conditions. Now that we know the sport can produce deadly results, where do we go from here? The Chronicle offers this special report on The Future of Football. Part 1: How is the NFL trying to make its game safer? Part 2: Youth football participation is a telling sign of things to come Part 3: What will the future of football really look like? Opinion: We know what needs to be done: But will we do it? Begley, 34, a San Francisco native who works as an app developer in Brooklyn, created a film that is a compilation of every reported concussion in an NFL regular season or postseason game in 2017. Begley’s film humanizes players, giving viewers a better sense of the violence they endure. After Fowler, the next two players shown in the film, wide receiver Mike Wallace and quarterback Joe Flacco of the Ravens, also have their faces exposed after  a helmet-dislodging hit. Wallace’s eyes are closed; Flacco’s mouth briefly hangs open. Begley also presents the moments of collision in reverse, in slow motion, in hopes of “defamiliarizing the familiar.” “For me, the rewinding, or the unwinding, allows me to look at them in a different way,” Begley said. “We all have the experience of walking into a restaurant or a bar and seeing a game. And it’s very easy: You’re immediately in football-watching mode, and there’s a certain kind of legibility to the game. And what does it mean to kind of pull that apart? And is there a way to see these scenes a little bit differently if it’s in reverse?” Begley is not anti-football. He’s a 49ers fan who “watches probably far too much football.” However, he’s increasingly struggled with the game’s violence. And he’s also given thought to the treatment of players who have peacefully knelt during the national anthem, partly to protest another form of violence. “It was thinking about violence more broadly — and the kind of violence that’s allowed to happen or be commented upon in the stage of a football field,” Begley said. “So I was thinking about Colin Kaepernick, thinking about players that are speaking out about a certain kind of police-involved violence. “And players that are not allowed to speak out, or are looked down upon for speaking out, what are the other kinds of violence their bodies are sustaining, along with being chastised?”Last year, after he was hired despite having zero executive experience, 49ers general manager John Lynch was asked about his nontraditional path from a Fox broadcast booth to a front office. In response, Lynch noted his entire football career had been unique. At Stanford, where he finished as an All-America safety, he spent his first two seasons as a never-used quarterback. In the NFL, where he finished with nine Pro Bowl selections, he didn’t become a full-time starter until his fourth season. “So,” Lynch said, “there’s a lot of things in my life that haven’t been conventional.” Two seasons into his latest football job, Lynch’s history should be comforting for restless 49ers fans: The Stanford graduate, Pro Football Hall of Fame finalist and well-respected broadcaster has enjoyed gobs of success, but it hasn’t come overnight. Now, after an early GM tenure featuring mixed results, this coming offseason would be an opportune time for Lynch to kick-start his career in the same way he did at Stanford and Tampa Bay. The 49ers will enter year three of their down-to-the-studs rebuild with two straight seasons of at least 10 losses and significant roster holes remaining at edge rusher, cornerback, wide receiver and inside linebacker. They have just five draft picks, having traded a 2019 fifth-round selection and a seventh-rounder, but  have the NFL’s third-highest amount of salary-cap space. As the clock winds down on 2018, The Chronicle profiles 10 influencers who will shape the Bay Area sports landscape in 2019. To be clear, this pivotal offseason isn’t all on Lynch: He has a joint partnership with head coach Kyle Shanahan on personnel decisions, but it’s the GM who is most closely associated with their roster moves. This season, it’s been Lynch’s Twitter handle to which fans have directed complaints about the  regime’s 2017 draft. That 10-man group began with five picks that range from disastrous to shaky: defensive tackle Solomon Thomas (first round), inside linebacker Reuben Foster (first), cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon (third), quarterback C.J. Beathard (third) and running back Joe Williams (fourth). Foster, who slipped in the draft because of character concerns, was released in November after his third arrest and Williams was released in August without playing a regular-season snap. Meanwhile, Thomas, a No. 3 pick, has four career sacks, Witherspoon was benched twice this season and Beathard, who took over for the injured Jimmy Garoppolo, lost his job to third-stringer Nick Mullens. Making those five selections uglier: The 49ers gave up fourth-, fifth- and seventh-round picks to trade up for Foster, Williams and Beathard, respectively. Despite that start, however, no one is linking Lynch to Matt Millen, another successful player and broadcaster who flopped after becoming the Lions’ GM with no front-office experience. And that’s because there have been finds mixed in with the flops. Most notable among those is Pro Bowl tight end George Kittle, a 2017 fifth-round pick who turned out to be one of the best selections in his draft. In addition, the 2018 haul, headlined by right tackle Mike McGlinchey (first round), wide receiver Dante Pettis (second) and inside linebacker Fred Warner (third), is encouraging. And his second draft suggests Lynch has done a better job of trusting his instincts in his new job. Last year, Lynch, among the hardest-hitting safeties in NFL history, initially had strong misgivings about Witherspoon, who often shied away from contact at Colorado. He became convinced Witherspoon would change in the NFL based partly on a conversation with his college coach, but Witherspoon’s finesse tackling has been an issue in his second season. Similarly, Lynch didn’t have Williams on the 49ers’ draft board because he questioned his love for football after the running back “retired” before returning to Utah during his final season. However, Shanahan thought Williams was an ideal fit for his offense. And Lynch reversed course after a phone conversation with Williams hours before the 49ers drafted him. After his first season, Shanahan said Williams needed to have more “urgency.” The player hasn’t resurfaced in the NFL since he was released Aug. 31. The back-and-forth between Lynch and Shanahan regarding Williams is known because Lynch shared the story with reporters during last year’s draft. It’s an example of Lynch’s transparency. And it’s in stark contrast to his tight-lipped predecessor, Trent Baalke, who once said of the 49ers: “When are we ever transparent?” Lynch has generally hit the right notes when speaking publicly, but there have been exceptions. In November, for example, Lynch said in a radio interview he thought the 49ers had enjoyed “two good drafts” since he’d been hired. Perhaps it was a momentary slip. After all, Lynch knows about genuine achievement. And in 2019, and beyond, he’ll have a chance to replicate the type of success he, eventually, enjoyed in his playing career.PJ Washington and Tyler Herro scored 18 points each as fourth-ranked Kentucky slogged past host Missouri 66-58 on Tuesday night. Ashton Hagans added 12 points for the Wildcats (22-4, 11-2 SEC), who looked a little sluggish three days after beating then-No. 1 Tennessee.  Kentucky still was good enough defensively to hold the Tigers to 37 percent shooting. Ronnie Suggs scored 13 and Jordan Geist finished with 11 for Missouri (12-13, 3-10). #5 Tennessee 58, Vanderbilt 46:  Grant Williams had 14 points and 11 rebounds, and the host Volunteers (24-2, 12-1 SEC) won in their first game since losing their No. 1 ranking.

Purdue has won three straight at Assembly Hall for the first time in school history. The Hoosiers(13-13, 4-11) lost their fourth straight overall and fifth in a row in the series. #16 Florida State 77, Clemson 64:  Mfiondu Kabengele had 19 points and 11 rebounds, and the visiting Seminoles (21-5, 9-4 ACC) set a program record with their eighth consecutive conference victory. The Tigers (15-11, 5-8) lost their third in a row and were swept by Florida State for the second time in three seasons. Baylor 73, #19 Iowa State 69:  Jared Butler scored 17 points, Freddie Gillespie had 14 and the visiting Bears upset the Cyclones (19-7, 8-5 Big 12). Makia Mason scored 14 points on 18 shots in his return from a toe injury for Baylor (17-9, 8-5). #24 Maryland 66, #21 Iowa 65:  In Iowa City, Bruno Fernando scored 11 points, including the last two on a putback with 7.8 seconds left, to lift the Terrrapins (20-7, 11-5 Big Ten), who blew an 11-point lead over the final four minutes. The Hawkeyes(20-6, 9-6), who had won their previous two games via buzzer-beaters, had two looks at the basket in the final seven seconds. #25 Buffalo 114, Ohio 67:  Jayvon Graves scored a career-high 26 points and the host Bulls (23-3, 11-2 MAC) set school records for 3-pointers  (19) and points against a Division I opponent. CJ Massinburg had 23 points for Buffalo. 3-on-3 event:  All-Star teams of college seniors will compete for a $150,000 prize in a 3-on-3 tournament at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., before this year’s  national championship game.

Andrea Torres’ 3-pointer with 8:09 left extended the Utes’ lead to 18 points, but those would be the only points scored by Utah (18-7, 7-7 Pac-12) in the final period. Robbi Ryan, who scored 10 of her 11 points in the fourth quarter, tied the game on a 3-pointer with 11.5 seconds left. After Torres was called for an offensive foul, Ekmark was fouled on a 3-point try and made the first two free-throw tries. “What an unbelievable fourth quarter by this team,” ASU head coach Charli Turner Thorne said. “They finally shifted gears, locked in. ... It was different people making plays down the stretch. It was really fun.” Arizona State (18-6, 9-4) — which had been down by six with 1:28 left before winning on a buzzer-beater in the teams’ first meeting — made its first five shots in the fourth quarter Sunday and finished 8-for-13 in the period.

In 2019, they’ll want to keep the No. 2 pick. At least that’s the opinion of Mel Kiper. On Tuesday, the ESPN draft analyst termed two edge rushers, Nick Bosa (Ohio State) and Josh Allen (Kentucky), and defensive tackle Quinnen Williams (Alabama) the three “super elite” prospects in this year’s draft. Kiper expects the Cardinals to select Bosa at No. 1, which would leave Allen for the pass-rush-starved 49ers, who have used a first-round pick on an interior defensive lineman in three of the past four seasons (Translation: They probably aren’t in the market for Williams). The Jets have the No. 3 pick. “There’s no question if you’re looking for an edge rusher and you’re the 49ers or the Jets, Josh Allen (is the pick),” Kiper said on a conference call. “People say trade out of there. If you trade out of there, you’re taking yourself out of the Josh Allen situation. “I don’t think the 49ers or Jets would want to do that. I know the Jets would like to pick up other draft picks, but if you move out of (No. 3) you don’t get Josh Allen if he’s there. And I’m not convinced he’ll be there. I think the 49ers could take him at (No. 2).” In 2017, the 49ers traded back one spot with the Bears -- correctly believing they were moving up for quarterback Mitch Trubisky -- and still landed the player they wanted, defensive lineman Solomon Thomas, at No. 3. In 2019, the Jets don’t need a quarterback after selecting Sam Darnold at No. 3 last year. In other words, the 49ers likely wouldn’t land Allen if they moved back. Of course, plenty could change over the next two months. Prospects’ stock will fluctuate after next week’s combine and subsequent pro days. And the 49ers’ need for an edge rusher might not be as pressing depending on whom they acquire in free agency. In addition, it’s possible the 49ers aren’t as bullish on Allen and wouldn’t mind trading down a few spots and picking up a highly regarded edge rusher such as Rashan Gary (Michigan) or Clelin Ferrell (Clemson). For his part, Kiper doesn’t think there’s a “big gap” between Allen and Bosa, the consensus No. 1 pick. Bosa’s high school career ended with a torn ACL and his college career ended after he had surgery last year for a core-muscle injury. Kiper cited Bosa’s injury history as a reason why Allen is a comparable prospect. Allen had 17 sacks in 2018 after back-to-back seven-sack seasons. “I think Bosa’s the guy,” Kiper said. “The only thing with Bosa is the durability. If it wasn’t for the injury his senior year in high school -- and the injury (last) year -- there wouldn’t be anybody close to him. And Allen had an unbelievable year … He was a solid player, but he became a great player this past year.”He felt like a rookie in his first big-league game. For years he had dreamed about the big waves of Mavericks, and now it was real, the startling notion of surfing alongside his heroes off the coast of Half Moon Bay. This was no ordinary rookie, however. Luca Padua was 13 years old. “Hey, kid, tell your dad to get you a real board,” joked John Raymond, an old-guard Mavericks surfer, noting Padua’s beat-up equipment. But as the days and years went on, Raymond noticed something else about the kid. “He got real good, very fast,” Raymond said this month. “Now he’s right up there with the best of ’em.” To his classmates at Half Moon Bay High School, Luca always seemed very much a man. He’s now a junior, with a 3.5 grade-point average that reflects genuine dedication to his classwork. But on the larger scale, he’s a legitimate player in the big-wave universe, combining the crucial elements of courage, humility and respect. Every top surfer in the Mavericks hierarchy knows his name. “I turn 42 in January, and Luca’s 16. Makes me feel super old,” said Hawaii’s Jamie Mitchell, one of the most decorated big-wave riders in the world. (Padua turned 17 on Dec. 17.) “Imagine him in six years. He’s already just an animal out there. But when he grows into his body, the mental aspect, and all that …” Mitchell drifted off, shaking his head and smiling. Another standout in giant surf, Hawaii’s Aaron Gold, called Padua “an amazing up-and-coming kid. I can’t wait to see him grow up, because he’s gonna be one of the top surfers at Mavericks. I mean, he already is.” As the clock winds down on 2018, The Chronicle profiles 10 influencers who will shape the Bay Area sports landscape in 2019. For the 10-part series, visit  www.sfchronicle.com/sportsinfluencers . When the biggest swells arrive, Padua doesn’t flinch. He’s either surfing or driving a Jet Ski on rescue missions, a crucial aspect of the Mavericks scene. When a 60-foot swell arrived  in January, one of Mavericks’ biggest in recent years, Padua couldn’t surf because of a lacerated hand and sprained knee. But when  water-safety expert Frank Quirarte  experienced the ultimate nightmare — his Jet Ski stalled, leaving him helpless in the path of a massive, onrushing set — Padua drove straight to the maelstrom and sped Quirarte to safety. When Mavericks pumped out big surf for days on end this month, Padua didn’t miss a session, routinely taking off on the biggest waves with remarkable success. To think that he’s already a seasoned surfer is difficult to grasp. No one has ever ventured into Mavericks so young. Jay Moriarity, the beloved Santa Cruz surfer who died in a free-diving accident off the Maldives islands (Indian Ocean) in June 2001, was 15 when he first went out there. “Thirteen is really young,” said Matt Warshaw, the sport’s leading historian, calling up comparisons to Hawaii’s Jeff Hakman and Mark Healey. “Russell Bierke (Australia) has been charging really hard since he was 13. That may be about it.” Padua didn’t tell his parents he was heading to Mavericks that first day. He was afraid they would turn him down, and he was right. Only two years prior, Padua was so scared of substantial surf, “even a 5-foot wave freaked me out,” he recalled. So what happened? “I really don’t know. Something switched.” He had an able mentor in Tim West, a coastside ocean-sports mainstay who surfed in the biggest-ever Mavericks contest (2010) and is now mostly focused on water-safety rescues. He knew Padua from the Junior Lifeguards program, and he could see him developing a thirst for bigger waves. They surfed together at Montara, Ocean Beach and points north, always seeking out a challenge of one’s stamina and willpower. When the day of reckoning arrived, Padua had turned 13 just a week before. He got a call from West, who told him, “Mavericks looks really good right now, and there are only five guys out.” “Hope you get some good ones,” said Luca. “Have an awesome time out there.” “No, I think you should come.” “You mean, to watch from the cliff?” “No, to surf. I think you should grab your wetsuit and come down to my house right now.” It wasn’t a giant day, with sets coming in around 18 feet, but that’s plenty big enough. Gathering his thoughts on the bench, “I was so nervous, I thought I was gonna puke,” Padua said. “But when I started paddling out, I lost the butterflies. I felt totally relaxed.” Luca’s older brother, Dom, recalled, “He immediately got this light feeling in his head, like, ‘All right, this is Mavericks, it’s go time.’ I get the chills thinking about it.” Only a fool charges out to Mavericks without studying the place, and Padua spent two hours in the channel that day, taking mental notes. Respectfully easing into the takeoff zone, he heard one of the older surfers tell him, “It’s your turn.” Padua wasn’t sure he was ready. “I sort of pretended to go, a half-ass paddle,” he recalled. “But Tim was paddling back out, we locked eyes for a second, and he goes, ‘Turn and burn!’ So I went. Going down that face, how steep it is, it really isn’t like surfing any other spot. But I rode that wave all the way to the inside, kicked out — and I was hooked. After that, I was just ...   it.” To his great relief, he got enthusiastic support from home. “No matter what my gut instinct wants as a parent, he is clearly driven to do this,” said his mother, Wendy. “I don’t want to stop him. It would be pointless. He went out and made it happen for himself.” Padua’s family is a testament to talent and enterprise. Wendy, of English-Irish descent, modestly describes herself as “an adrenaline seeker,” finding thrills in parachuting and extreme whitewater rafting. Daughter Sophia, 20, is a junior at Oregon after spending the summer studying in Berlin. Dom, just a year out of high school, where he was a two-way player on the Half Moon Bay football team that reached last year’s Division 3-A state championship game, is an accomplished videographer with a professional body of work, much of it documenting Luca’s career. Then there’s the father, Gino, known to many coastsiders as the drummer for the Califuegos, a tasteful four-man band. He’s also a lifelong sailor and an executive in the software business. He explains his heritage as “Spanish, Filipino, Mexican and a whole bunch of other mixture.” As alarmed as he was about Luca’s first Mavericks adventure, Gino had faith in his son’s instincts. “He came out of the womb like a little yoda,” Gino said. “The wisdom kid. He’s an astute learner. He studies. You know, I still think he’s a better baseball player than a surfer. He could hit, he could pitch, and he was a catcher, where you have to know what everybody else is doing. It’s a tough position, physically and mentally. And what I liked about him, he’d have this great game, but never talked about it. It was always about how well the other guys did. Surfing is his main thing now, but he’s always been about as mature a kid as you could find.” Gino has always stressed education above all else, and he was gratified to know that Luca worked out an arrangement with his high school officials, allowing him to skip school on the really special surfing days as long as he keeps up his grades. Needless to say, it’s not a privilege commonly granted. “We try to support students following their passion and their dreams,” said Half Moon Bay High Principal John Nazar. “We all know that Luca is a special athlete, pursuing a sport at the highest level. We know that when the waves come, he’s got to get organized and go. He’s a very strong student, and a great young man. I place a very high value on how he treats all his classmates with respect and kindness. All of these things made it a very easy decision for us.” His coach on the high school surf team, Mike Wallace, said, “Luca’s in the sweet spot. He’s picked up some sponsors (notably Quiksilver and Zola, which makes energy drinks). He gets first-rate boards (from noted San Diego shaper Stu Kenson). He’s got a built-in PR system with his brother’s documentation. He’s earned the respect of the Mavericks surfers, some of them like 30 years older. He got out in front of his academics, allowing him to surf the best days. And he’s training like a madman.” Inside the Raul Castillo Martial Arts gym in Half Moon Bay, Luca has become a student of Matt Aragoni, an  MMA fighter. They train together three hours a day on average, sometimes as much as six hours. “Matt’s a beast, an absolute beast,” said Padua, solidly built at 5-foot-9 and 160 pounds. “He put me on this path, and it changes your mind-set. When you’re in peak physical shape, you feel like nothing can stop you. When I’m 20 feet underwater getting smoked by a wave at Mavericks, I know that I trained for this exact situation. I got myself into it — now I’m gonna get myself right back out.” Padua has become so well known in the international big-wave community, a number of out-of-town surfers stash their equipment at the Padua home in El Granada, some even staying there during big swells. Meanwhile, he isn’t content to make his name at Mavericks. He traveled this year to Nazare, Portugal, to surf after the World Surf League contest was held there, and to the Pico Alto International contest in Peru, where he became a last-minute entry and reached the semifinals. “As soon as we got down to Peru, we came across guys from South America, Mexico and Hawaii getting ready for the event,” said Gino. “They’d never met Luca, but through social media, they knew about him. They were all like, ‘Oh, you’re that  .’” In the wake of Moriarity’s death, there was no sign of a new Mavericks generation. Many years passed before the old guard sensed any presence of up-and-coming locals. But the times have changed in Half Moon Bay. Padua is a proud member of the “Mavs Mafia,” as they call themselves, including Hunter Murison, Peter and Thomas Lundgard, Michael Joshua, Thomas Agramonte and Dom Padua, shooting video from the water. When the 24-man contest list was announced for this year, Padua was chosen only as an alternate. “Mostly because he’s so young,” said Grant Washburn, part of a committee that determines six spots reserved for local surfers. “A lot of guys are charging hard out there, having put in a lot more years. Luca’s time will definitely come.” Murison, a 20-year-old Half Moon Bay lifeguard, did make the list. “I’m   excited about that,” Luca said. “I’ll be out there by his side, caddying, waxing his boards for him, giving him that last pat on the back before his heat. I realize I’ve got a lot of time. I know my age had a lot to do with it. But in my head, I figure I haven’t done enough. I’ll just train a thousand times harder.” “I think it’s actually a good thing he’s not in it,” Wendy said. “It’s a good life lesson. Getting that gratification from the get-go almost doesn’t seem right. It’s super-cool that you’re as dedicated as you are, doing all the right things, but you should have to work your ass off for a while before you get that kind of call.” There’s a person missing in the Mavs Mafia team photo. Malcolm Feix died in a surfing accident at Pomponio State Beach in July  at the age of 20. It seemed the entire coastside turned out for a memorial paddle-out at the Princeton Harbor jetty because Feix touched so many lives as a lifeguard, water polo coach, 4-H Club counselor, high school leadership standout and electrical engineering student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. It was only recently that Luca could talk about  Feix without breaking into tears. “He was my big brother, you know? He was family. He’s the one who convinced me to learn how to surf. He taught me how to make a peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich,” he said with a laugh. “‘Show up and be kind’ was one of his favorite slogans, and he lived it. Since the day he died, we’re all just ... make him proud. Do it for Malcolm. He was, and always will be, my hero.”TEMPE, Ariz. — Rob Edwards didn’t need to take many shots to have an efficient performance for Arizona State. The junior guard scored 16 points on 6-for-8 shooting and added five rebounds and four assists to help the Sun Devils to an 80-62 win over Stanford on Wednesday night. Backcourt mate Remy Martin added 16 points, and the Sun Devils (18-8, 9-5 Pac-12) earned a key conference win with only one of their final four regular-season games left at home. They have alternated wins and losses in their past seven games. “Just trying to get confidence for March and tournament time,” Edwards said. “Just trying to pick it up and help everybody else so that we can get ready and win games. That’s what we’ve got to do.” Stanford (14-12, 7-7) entered having won five of its past six games but played without  KZ Okpala, who sustained what head coach Jerod Haase called an upper-body injury in a recent practice and was held out. The forward is Stanford’s leading scorer at 17.5 points per game. Josh Sharma’s 17 points led the Cardinal, who got  15  from Oscar  da Silva. “I don’t think it impacted our shooting. I think it impacted the game because he is so talented, but the guys that were shooting the shots were the guys I wanted, and they are very talented,” Haase said of not having Okpala. Arizona State led by no fewer than six in a slow-moving second half, then pulled away with a 3 from Zylan Cheatham and an Edwards jumper with 4:50 to play for a 66-52 lead. A deep 3 from Edwards as the shot clock expired with 2:07 to play gave Arizona State a 74-60 lead and sealed the win. The Cardinal missed all 12 3-point tries in the second half and finished 2-for-20 from long range. Stanford capped a 7-0 run with Sharma’s dunk to make it 18-15 at the midway point of the first half. But a layup by Luguentz Dort put the Sun Devils back in front, and they held the lead the rest of the half. Martin’s 3 with 37 seconds left until halftime got the crowd on its feet and gave Arizona State the 42-34 lead the Sun Devils had at halftime. “They have a very talented team and they were able to get enough makes to never let us get too close,” Haase said.Duke keeps finding its way back to No. 1. The Blue Devils reclaimed the top spot in Monday’s AP Top 25, the third time this season they’ve reached No. 1. Duke earned 58 of 64 first-place votes to climb one spot and replace Tennessee, which had spent four weeks at No. 1 but fell to fifth after Saturday’s loss at Kentucky. Duke has  spent nearly half of the season’s polls (seven of 16) at No. 1, and hasn’t been ranked lower than fourth since the preseason. The Blue Devils (23-2) — who start four  freshmen in RJ Barrett, Zion Williamson, Cam Reddish and Tre Jones — haven’t lost a game at full strength since falling to Gonzaga in the Maui Invitational championship game. Gonzaga (25-2) earned the remaining six first-place votes and moved up a spot to No. 2, followed by Virginia and head coach John Calipari’s Wildcats — who have made a long climb back after falling from No. 2 following the Duke loss to as low as No. 19 in mid-December. Nevada, Michigan, UNC, Houston and Michigan State rounded out the top 10. Briefly:  Michigan State forward Nick Ward had surgery on his broken left hand and is expected to be out at least a few weeks. Ward is the team’s second-leading scorer at 15.1 points a game and third-leading rebounder at 6.7 per game. The 6-foot-9 junior returned to school after putting his name in the NBA draft last year. ... Former Arizona head coach Lute Olson has been hospitalized after enduring a minor stroke over the weekend. Banner University Medical Center said in a news release that the 84-year-old Hall of Famer is in good condition. women History for Rice: 1st time in poll Tina Langley had a vision when she took over Rice’s women’s program four years ago. The Owls have been steadily improving every season and  can add a Top 25 appearance to their achievements. Rice, which has won 15 straight games, entered the AP women’s poll for the first time in school history at No. 25 on Monday. “I’m so grateful to the student-athletes and coaches that have come here and poured their heart and soul into the program,” said Langley, who spent seven years as an assistant and associate head coach under Brenda Frese at Maryland before coming to Rice. Baylor remained the top team in the country, receiving 26 of the 28 first-place votes from a national media panel. Oregon moved up to second, getting the other two No. 1 ballots. UConn was third, and Louisville slipped to fourth after losing to Miami on Sunday. The Hurricanes made the biggest jump, moving up six spots to 14th. Notre Dame was fifth. Mississippi State, Stanford, Maryland, North Carolina State and Iowa rounded out the top 10. Stanford’s Smith honored:  Stanford’s Alanna Smith has been named Pac-12 Player of the Week for her performances in the Cardinal’s road sweep of UCLA and USC. It\\'s the Australian forward\\'s fourth career weekly conference honor and her third of the season.On a cool August morning in Napa, the Oakland Raiders and Detroit Lions gathered on the grassy fields behind Redwood Middle School for a joint training camp practice. After a long offseason, the sound of cracking pads and quarterback cadence signaled the return of NFL football. Eager spectators filled metal bleachers overlooking the action, welcoming the early signs of the coming season. The crowd included players from a pair of local high school teams. Following the practice, Raiders head coach Jon Gruden was asked about having those young athletes in attendance. What did it mean to him? Why bring them out? His answer was emphatic. “I think it’s smart for everybody at this level, pro football, NFL, to give back to youth football,” Gruden said. “We’ve got a problem, I think, in this country. The game is under siege by a lot of people who don’t think it’s a safe game. They don’t think it’s a good game anymore. And I think that’s hogwash.” Gruden’s passion speaks to the growing debate surrounding youth football. Many love the sport. But mounting evidence shows that playing football can be extremely dangerous,  even deadly in the long run. Is it a good idea for young players to participate? That is an increasingly louder discussion. By almost any measure, football remains the most popular sport in the United States, a fact reflected by the number of those who play it. According to the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), more than 1 million boys played football nationally in 2017 — nearly equaling the totals of basketball and baseball combined. Thousands more suited up for youth leagues like Pop Warner, beginning as early as age 5. Yet those numbers are decreasing. The number of high school boys playing tackle football has been in slow but steady decline for nearly a decade. The trend has coincided with heightened concern about the frequency and lasting impact of head injuries on young athletes — with former NFL stars among those questioning whether they’d let their sons play football, and some states weighing whether to establish minimum age limits for the sport. A recent Friday night in the Bay Area provided a jarring snapshot of football’s risks. On Sept. 21, Heritage-Brentwood and Freedom-Oakley each had a player airlifted to a local hospital after sustaining in-game injuries. Another game between Benicia and St. Patrick-St. Vincent-Vallejo was reportedly cut short after several SPSV players exited with injuries. The injured players from Heritage and Freedom were both released from the hospital shortly thereafter, according to team and school officials. Such incidents have led some parents and players to consider other options. Overall, participation in 11-player football fell about 6.9 percent between the 2008 and 2017 seasons, according to the NFHS. The trend has led Roger Pielke Jr., director of the Sports Governance Center at University of Colorado, to study the numbers and draw a conclusion. “There’s enough evidence to say that football, as a youth sport, has peaked,” Pielke said. Counter to an overall increase in the number of high school athletes nationwide, participation in football declined by more than 75,000 players from 2008 to 2017. Some states gained players in that span, including Florida (3.5 percent) and  Texas (2.3), according to the NFHS.  Others saw large decreases in participation, including Ohio (23 percent), Michigan (21.6) and New York (21.2). The total number of schools offering football stayed consistent over that time. But while states such as Florida (77 more), Tennessee (35) and Georgia (38) added programs, others had more schools drop the sport. There were net decreases of 46 programs in Ohio, 51 in Oklahoma and 36 in Iowa. Chris Boone, NFHS assistant director of communications and publications, said one factor may be athletes branching out, explaining that areas where football numbers have dipped “tend to be states that have introduced new and emerging sports.” Players for McClymonds-Oakland warm up before a game against Marin Catholic in Oakland on Aug. 24. Football-related injuries represent another major concern. Efforts have been made to research those injuries. One study sponsored in part by the NFHS is the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study, a tool that gathers weekly online reports from certified athletic trainers at a national sampling of high schools and uses the data to analyze injury patterns and trends. The study, begun in 2005 by Dr. Dawn Comstock, now of the Colorado School of Public Health, estimates the rate of high school sports-related injuries per athletic exposure — competitions and practices at which an athlete was exposed to potential injury. Freshman Maura Baglin leads the Sacred Heart Cathedral football team onto the field with a bagpipe solo before a game against St. Ignatius in San Francisco on Oct. 5. Football’s injury rate has consistently been the highest among sports tracked by the study. In 2017-18, the study estimated a rate of 4.33 injuries per 1,000 exposures in football, compared with a rate of 2.45 per 1,000 overall in prep sports. It was the third-highest annual injury rate for football in the 13 years of the study, up from 3.56 per 1,000 exposures in 2016-17, which was the third lowest. Most football injuries, according to the study, occurred  from being tackled or tackling. Most happen between the 20-yard lines and to those playing the positions of running back, linebacker and receiver. But while those trends stayed constant, there was a notable shift in diagnoses. In 2006-07, the study’s most commonly diagnosed football injury was an ankle sprain or strain (12.5 percent), followed by concussions (10.4 percent). Eleven years later, concussions accounted for 26.3 percent of reported injuries — likely due at least in part to increased scrutiny of head injuries. Comstock said the increase in reported concussions has occurred in all sports monitored by the study, not just football. “We’ve had an intense focus on this issue over the last decade-plus,” Comstock said. “There probably aren’t that many more concussions that are occurring now than before. But when a concussion does occur in a high school athlete, in the past too many of those were going unrecognized, undiagnosed. And now fewer are going unrecognized and undiagnosed.” In California, where 11-player football participation has fallen almost 10 percent over the past decade, the governing body for high school sports has adopted policies geared toward player safety, said California Interscholastic Federation executive director Roger Blake. A standing rule requires players in all sports to be removed from games or practices if they show signs of concussion and to be cleared by a doctor before they can return. Beginning in 2018, the CIF halved the amount of full-contact hitting allowed in football practices to a total of 90 minutes per week over two days. Pittsburg quarterback Trey Turner (6) and wide receiver Willie Harts III (3) enter the field through smoke before a game against Serra-San Mateo on Sept. 7 in Pittsburg. “The science kept telling us less is better,” Blake said. “So listening to the sports medicine people, our docs, that’s the direction we’ve followed with our schools.” Still, fewer high school students are playing football. And Blake said the CIF frequently hears the same explanation from its coaches. “They’re saying youth programs in football, at the local level, those numbers have declined,” Blake said. “So they can anticipate the number of kids coming up is going to decline.” Central to the debate around football: At what  age, if any, should children be allowed to begin playing? Tyler Turner of the Berkeley Jr. Bears Pop Warner Football Tiny Mites takes a break with teammates during a football jamboree at Oak Grove High School in San Jose on Aug. 26. Medical research increasingly shows a link between repeated head impacts and long-term brain disease, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a progressive degenerative brain disease found in people who have experienced brain trauma. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “it is not yet known how many repeated head or brain injuries increase the risk for CTE,” but the “greatest risk factor for CTE is the number of years of exposure to repeated head or brain injuries.” It’s one reason Chris Nowinski, co-founder of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, which is dedicated to head injury research, supports the idea of restricting tackling before high school. The brain, he said, is still developing at that time. “The brain is going through incredible changes between the age of 8 and 13,” Nowinski said. “You don’t have to be a neuroscientist to think it’s a bad idea to hit a child in the head hundreds of times at the most critical point of their brain development.” That concern has gained high-profile exposure in recent years.

Hall of Famers Brett Favre and Mike Ditka, along with former running back Bo Jackson, have all publicly said they would dissuade their sons from playing football. In 2014, then-President Barack Obama was quoted in the New Yorker as saying he “would not let my son play pro football.” Some lawmakers have suggested taking the decision out of parents’ hands — though without much success. By April of this year, bills had been introduced in five states proposing to ban tackle football at the youth level. A Maryland bill that would have prohibited tackling before high school was shot down in March by a committee vote. Measures in Illinois, New York and New Jersey proposing to outlaw tackle before age 12 weren’t expected to gain much traction.

The Berkeley Jr. Bears Pop Warner Football Tiny Mites take a break after the first game during a football jamboree at Oak Grove High School in San Jose on Aug. 26. In California, the Safe Youth Football Act calling for a ban on tackle football before high school (and later amended to age 12) received swift backlash after it was introduced in February. Its opponents circulated an online petition that collected more than 40,000 signatures and rallied outside the State Capitol. The bill was pulled in April prior to a committee vote. Some youth programs have taken their own action. USA Football, youth football’s governing body, established guidelines in 2015 limiting contact to 30 minutes per practice, 120 minutes per week in preseason and 90 minutes per week in the regular season. In 2017, USA Football reported more than 7,000 youth leagues and about 3,400 high schools enrolled in its “Heads Up Football” player safety program. In 2016, Pop Warner eliminated kickoffs,  considered one of the sport’s most dangerous plays,  in its three youngest age divisions. It also reduced the amount of contact time allowed in practice from 33 percent to 25 percent. Still, youth leagues have seen their numbers dwindle. Participation in youth football dropped nearly 30 percent between 2008 and 2013, according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association. That trend has extended to parts of the Bay Area. Andre Hunt, president of Coyote Creek Youth Sports in San Jose, said the club used to be able to field teams in all six divisions of Pop Warner, averaging 30 to 35 players per team. This year, Hunt said, Coyote Creek has four teams totaling about 130 players. Hunt said factors include safety concerns, but also changing demographics and costs of equipment and fees to families. “People talk about the concussion part, and yes, with certain parents that is a concern,” Hunt said. “With other parents, it’s not a concern enough to keep them from allowing their kids to play football. But for those parents, the economics become a real concern.” The East Bay Panthers, a member of American Youth Football, merged with another team last year to stay active due to low enrollment, said President Jacob Davis. “Most of the parents are worried about the concussions,” Davis said. Dylan Yanez Maldonado of the Berkeley Jr. Bears Pop Warner Football Tiny Mites is tackled during a jamboree in San Jose. Davis said the Panthers test players with HitCheck, a smartphone concussion testing aid, before games and during if they sustain a big hit. The club also teaches Hawk Tackling, a rugby-style tackling technique popularized by the NFL’s Seattle Seahawks that is designed to avoid use of the head. For years, mounting evidence has linked football violence with brain trauma and life-threatening conditions. Now that we know the sport can produce deadly results, where do we go from here? Today:  Youth football participation is a telling sign of things to come. B1 Tuesday:  What will the future of football really look like? Online:  Read the full series online now at www.sfchronicle.com/future-of-football One evening this June, the Panthers and the San Leandro Crusaders gathered at Burrell Field in San Leandro, where each team received a grant of $50,000 through the Dick’s Sporting Goods Foundation, its Sports Matter youth outreach program. The presentation was made by Gruden, the Raiders’ coach, who also gave a pep talk to the players and ran a few of the older kids through drills. Gruden became involved with the Sports Matter program in 2014 while working for ESPN, saying he noticed numbers declining in youth and high school football. “There’s some fear out there,” Gruden said. “I think people are missing the boat. I think they’re just hearing the negative stories all the time. They don’t really hear from people like me, or people that played the game, that really benefited by learning their work ethic, sportsmanship, their mental and physical toughness and all the discipline and accountability you have to have. “It’s not an easy game. I just want kids to play if they want to play. I don’t want people to make the decision for them.” Jason Tatum, who’d brought his son, Cameron, 11, a wide receiver and quarterback, to Burrell Field, said the potential for head injuries in football is concerning. “Watching them over the years, they don’t really do a lot of helmet-to-helmet tackling,” Tatum said. “As they get older and guys are hitting harder, then maybe we’ll shift sports. But right now it’s just really good exercise for them, gives them a really solid sense of discipline.” Already, the overall ebb in football participation has Pielke, the Colorado professor, wondering about the long-term implications for the nation’s most popular sport. The current rate of decline at youth and high school levels likely won’t affect the college or NFL levels for years. But will the current rate remain steady? Might it be a precursor to something more dramatic? “It’s a guess,” Pielke said, “but I’m pretty confident it’s not going to turn around and zoom to new numbers anytime soon.”   Matt Kawahara is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email:  mkawahara@sfchronicle.com  Twitter:  @matthewkawahara   Why fewer kids are playing football: A study in declineConcord teenager  Yealimi Noh  made it official this week in announcements on Instagram and Twitter: She has turned professional. Erik Stone, Noh’s Alameda-based coach, said she already has played at least one event on the Korean LPGA Tour and another on the Cactus Tour in Arizona. Noh tied for eighth in the tournament in Litchfield Park, Ariz., Feb. 4-6. She delayed this week’s announcement until she finalized her endorsement contracts. “She’s ready,” Stone said Wednesday. “She’s on her way. It was the right decision for her.” By turning professional, Noh relinquished her exemptions to play as an amateur in the ANA Inspiration, Augusta National Women’s Amateur, U.S. Women’s Open and Evian Masters. She still can try to qualify for the Open as a pro. Noh, 17, plans to play additional events on the Korean LPGA Tour, Stone said, and hopes to land sponsor exemptions on the U.S.-based LPGA Tour. One obvious possibility: the Mediheal Championship at Lake Merced, May 2-5. Noh burst into prominence last summer, when she enjoyed a staggering run of success. In three consecutive weeks in July, she won three national tournaments: the Junior PGA in Kentucky, the  U.S. Girls Junior  at Poppy Hills and the Canadian Women’s Amateur in Vancouver. Then, in September, she helped the U.S. win the Junior Ryder Cup in Paris. Noh soared into the top 20 in the world amateur rankings. Even before those victories, Noh withdrew her commitment to UCLA and decided to turn pro. Now it’s official, even though she doesn’t have status on the LPGA Tour. In a September interview with The Chronicle, she said she would seek LPGA sponsor exemptions, enter Monday qualifying events and gain experience playing on mini-tours. “It’s so exciting,” she said then. “I’m ready. I just can’t wait to be on tour. Who knows if I win one (in 2019) after Monday qualifying? Brooke Henderson did that. It’s possible. I’m just excited to see what comes next.” Noh has endorsement deals with Hana Financial Group and Descente clothing, according to her Instagram post.Lucy Li, the  acclaimed 16-year-old golfer  from Redwood City, will maintain her  amateur status  despite violating a rule by participating in an Apple Watch advertising campaign last month. The United States Golf Association announced Thursday that Li breached Rule 6-2 with her involvement in the Apple video, but the USGA’s amateur status committee decided to issue a one-time warning rather than strip Li of her amateur standing. That allows Li to play in the inaugural Augusta National Women’s Amateur in April, plus other marquee events open only to non-professionals. Li, who’s eighth in this week’s world amateur ranking, appeared in the Apple video  Jan. 2. That was the first time Li and her parents were aware the video would be released and could jeopardize her amateur status, according to Thomas Pagel, the USGA’s senior managing director of governance. Li contacted Apple to have the advertisement taken down and the company complied. On Jan. 11, the USGA informed Li she had violated the rules governing amateur eligibility. The subsequent investigation revealed that a casting agent approached Li late last year about appearing in the ad, according to the USGA, but did not define the nature of her participation. Li spent four days shooting video; she appeared with her golf clubs on the last day, Pagel said. “On the last day, they indicated to her they didn’t know if video would be used and what clips would be used,” he said in a phone interview. “She didn’t fully understand that appearing as a golfer would be a breach of the rules of amateur status. “If this were to happen today, I think the family would know enough to ask all the right questions.” Li posted on Twitter shortly after Thursday’s announcement: “I have apologized to the USGA and accept my responsibility in participating in the Apple Watch ad. It was never my intention to cause the USGA and myself to be in this position. “The USGA is like family to me, and I appreciate the thorough review of all the facts and the consideration I’ve been given. I’m looking forward to continue playing as an amateur and to do all I can to promote this great game.” An Apple spokesman declined to comment, referring questions to the USGA and the Li family. The Apple Watch ads are part of the company’s “Close Your Rings” campaign, designed to promote a feature monitoring the wearer’s movements. The videos on apple.com showed several active people, including Li and Olympic swimmer Haley Anderson, moving and exercising while wearing the watch. Li’s 15-second appearance included her hitting shots, walking on a golf course, mimicking her swing in a pool, holding a birthday cake and smiling into the camera. Virtually all of the video centers on golf. Zeng told Golf Digest last month that Li did not receive compensation for her participation in the campaign. The USGA acknowledged this in its statement Thursday. According to the USGA’s Rules of Amateur Status, a golfer can be in violation of Rule 6-2 of “even if no payment or compensation is received” for appearing in an ad. Pagel indicated the USGA leaned on precedent in deciding to issue the warning to Li. One example: Chinese golfer Andy Zhang, who promoted clubs made by family friends soon after he played in the 2012 U.S. Open at the Olympic Club in San Francisco. Zhang, upon realizing his violation, stopped the commercial and wrote a letter apologizing to the USGA. He also was handed a warning. Zhang now is a professional and plays on the Web.com Tour. As for Li’s case, Pagel said, “There needs to be an appreciation for how complicated these cases can be, when you truly are trying to understand the facts. There are decades of past cases where similar warnings have been issued. “Also, we are dealing with a minor here. While there was a breach of amateur status, no compensation was exchanged and no ultimate benefits were gained. The spirit of the rules have very much been upheld. I think Lucy and others will learn from this.” Li burst into public view as a giggling, ponytailed, 11-year-old who played her way into the  2014 U.S. Women’s Open  in North Carolina. She became the youngest golfer ever to qualify for America’s national championship. Nearly five years later, she’s one of the world’s most accomplished amateurs. Li made the cut in two major championships last year, and she also led the U.S. to victory in the Curtis Cup and Junior Ryder Cup, prestigious team events. Last month, Li was among 66 players who  accepted an invitation to play in the inaugural Augusta National Women’s Amateur,  April 3-6.MESA, Ariz. - Ask most people which young A’s pitcher to keep an eye on, and they’ll say Jesus Luzardo. Ask Luzardo, and he’ll tell you Parker Dunshee. “Definitely put Parker on your radar,” Luzardo said. “Nothing stands out when you talk to him or look at him - but everything he does is good. He knows how to pitch, he’s smart on the mound, he throws everything where he wants to. He’s just good.” Like Luzardo, Dunshee, 24, was one of just a handful of A’s minor-leaguers to get an invite to spring training, and the only one who was drafted just two years ago. Here’s why: He had a 0.00 ERA at Class-A Vermont in 2017, and last season he put up a 2.33 ERA combined between Class-A Stockton and Double-A Midland. His minor-league ERA total with Oakland: 1.98. “Parker is a guy you want on the mound every day,” Double-A Midland outfielder Skye Bolt said. “He’s tenacious, he makes quick work of hitters and he’s got great tempo on the mound. He’s there to attack hitters and force the issue. It helps that his stuff is really good: He gets a lot of swings-and-misses and he gets a lot of weak contact. Games go quickly.” Dunshee grew up in Zionsville, Ind., and went to Wake Forest, where he was 28-10 with a 3.20 ERA and set the school record for strikeouts with 330. The A’s selected him in the seventh round. The next round, the A’s took 6-foot-9 right-hander Brian Howard, 23, from St. Louis University. Howard is best buddies with Dunshee and Luzardo. He has been at every level with Dunshee, but is not in camp. Howard’s minor-league ERA is a whole 2.58, so he didn’t quite make the cut. Suffice to say, the A’s have high hopes for this group of starters. “You could talk about Dunshee and Howard as almost the same person,” A’s director of player development Keith Lieppman said. “They have almost identical numbers, they’re aggressive college pitchers who are unafraid of contact, they come right at you. … They are 2017 draftees approaching Triple-A already. That’s a rapid rise through the system.” A key for Dunshee has been his changeup, which he began incorporating more last year at the insistence of minor-league coaches Gil Patterson and Bryan Corey. “He was forced to throw it,” Corey said. “I’m a big proponent of it. And this is about developing so you can move on to higher levels.” “It’s a pitch I just wasn’t using enough,” Dunshee said. “They were on me all the time about it, but I was so stubborn; I didn’t want to get beat with it. But I’ve learned that it’s a pitch I can use. It’s really been the key to my improvement.” Patterson said that it was a little bit of a hard sell. “When you’re performing well in the minors, you can be hesitant to change,” Patterson said. “If he’d been struggling, he might have bought in earlier, but he’d come out of a good start and I’d say, ‘I’m not very happy.’ He’d say, ‘Seven innings, one run, seven strikeouts, one walk?’ And I’d say, ‘No.’ Not all successful major-league starters have changeups - but most of them do.” Patterson remembers having a similar conversation with Hall of Famer Roy Halladay when he coached Halladay in the Toronto organization. “He didn’t really need one,” Patterson said of Halladay. “But eventually, he needed it.” Patterson, considered a cutter guru, also helped Dunshee with that pitch, and Dunshee said he mimicked the way Howard throws his plus-cutter. Now that he’s in big-league camp, Dunshee is trying to learn as much as possible from the more experienced starters, such as Marco Estrada, Mike Fiers and Daniel Mengden, especially during their weekly meetings. “I’m just kind of listening,” he said. “They have a lot of knowledge and they’ve thrown a lot of big-league pitches.” Despite Dunshee’s reluctance to throw a changeup, he’s quickly turned into one of Patterson’s favorites. “He’s phenomenal,” said Patterson, who’d pushed to get Dunshee to big-league camp. “Sure, he’s stubborn, but it’s one of those things: ‘What makes you great?’ ‘I’m stubborn.’ ‘What makes you not so great?’ ‘I’m stubborn.’ “He is a great competitor, a fierce competitor. As great as he is as a player, I wouldn’t mind having him for a son. That’s how much I think of him. Also, the not listening - perfect for a son.”Points flow off Haley Jones’ hands as steadily as her braids cascade down her back, obscuring her No. 30. Nobody really needs to identify her by her number, anyway. She establishes her presence with (in quick order) a driving shot with her left hand off the glass, a turnaround jumper with her right hand and a three-point basket with a textbook shooting style, a bounce pass that she threads to a teammate for a layup that’s missed. No matter, because Jones is there to put back the rebound. Her Mitty team is clobbering Christian Brothers-Sacramento in  the Elite Showcase at Chabot College in Hayward. At the moment, there’s really only one elite player on the court. Jones outscores the opponents 30-29 by herself. She also grabs 22 rebounds in the 67-29 win. Her rebound total is impressive for a point guard, although it helps to be a sturdy 6-foot-1. On her level, she’s like Magic Johnson, whom she has seen on video. “Haley has a lot of freedom out there,” said her coach, Sue Phillips. That is, she sometimes plays on the wing and in the post. “She’s the poster child for position-less basketball.” Jones is the No. 1 high school recruit in the country and is expected to make an immediate impact when she enters Stanford in the fall. She’ll probably play the point in college because what she does better than everything else is pass. On this afternoon, Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer is sitting between Jones’ parents, Patrick and Monique Jones. VanDerveer has been watching Jones for years — Haley has a photo of her with VanDerveer at a summer camp when Jones was in fifth grade. Stanford was not her dream school from an early age, Jones said. “That might have made the process a little harder,” she said, as opposed to “just waiting for that one offer, to commit there.” Jones narrowed her options to 11 schools when she entered her junior year. She later reduced them to five: Stanford, Notre Dame, UConn, Oregon and South Carolina. She had to delay her final announcement a day because Mitty was closed because of bad air quality caused by the Butte County fire. “It wasn’t stressful until the end when she had to make a decision,” Patrick said. Although the long recruiting process went remarkably well, her parents are glad it’s over. “We don’t have to worry about who’s watching or who’s calling,” Patrick said. “We can just enjoy her season.” And the four after that because Maples Pavilion isn’t far away. As the clock winds down on 2018, The Chronicle profiles 10 influencers who will shape the Bay Area sports landscape in 2019. The top five recruits for 2019, according to the HoopGurlz Recruiting Rankings on espn.com: Name High School College Haley Jones Archbishop Mitty Stanford Jordan Horston Columbus Africentric (Ohio) Tennessee Aliyah Boston Worcester Academy (Mass.) S. Carolina Samantha Brunelle William Monroe (Va.) Notre Dame Ashley Owusu Paul VI (Va.) Maryland Mitty unofficially was crowned national champion last season even though it lost in the Northern California final. The Monarchs had beaten four national heavyweights in an Arizona tournament earlier. Mitty’s is a robust program: Jones has played with 10 teammates who went  to Division I college ball. In the game at Chabot, she seems to glide along, ready to make a move with her quick hands. She generally stays under control, although she commits a reaching foul early. She repeatedly sets up her teammates for shots; it looks as if  she easily could score 50 if she weren’t so unselfish. Of course, her teammates are also her best friends. “I think a lot of kids at our school are intimidated by her,” guard Charlize Andaya said, “but she’s so friendly. She’s the funniest person I know.” Late in the game, with Mitty up by 40, Jones drives, puts the ball around her back and puts up a reverse layup. It falls off the rim. She spends the next few minutes laughing about the play with her teammates. She had scored on the same move in the previous game, she notes. As for playing under control, she said, “There are definitely times when you feel awkward or out of position, like on defense or when you try to move faster than normal, but I think it’s a great strength for anyone to mask it so other people can’t see it. If I ever feel awkward, I try to center myself and not do something that’s outside of myself and my game.” Her family lives in Santa Cruz, a 45-minute drive from Mitty if traffic is light. She has been driving to school for two years; before that, she carpooled. As a result of mudslides on Highway 17, one trip home after a game two years ago took seven hours. Santa Cruz is a  diverse community, so Haley said being biracial (Monique is black, Patrick white) has not been a problem. In fact, she said, it’s “a great strength of mine. I think it makes it easier for me to make connections with different cultures and to be immersed in people’s lives.” From early childhood, Patrick said, Haley  served as a social director. “She has fun and wants everyone around her to have fun,” he said. “She’s very inclusive as a person. When she was in elementary school, she was always the one organizing games on the playground or after school.” Patrick is 6-7, Monique 5-10. She moved from Georgia to California when she was 13. They met at Santa Cruz High, where both played basketball. He later played at Division III Colorado College. They coached the girls team at their alma mater for 15 years. Haley was putting up shots since she was big enough to hold a basketball. “I grew up in a gym, hanging out with their players, shooting by myself for hours on end,” she said. She was a state gymnastics champion at age 9 and such a good soccer player that she didn’t decide to go all in for basketball until high school. She had a built-in incentive, trying to keep up with her older brother, Cameron, who played football and basketball at Palma-Salinas. She started playing organized basketball in third grade. Mom was the coach. “She would say I’m the hardest and the worst,” Monique said with a smile. One of Monique’s cousins is DeLisha Milton-Jones, a two-time Olympic gold medalist who spent 17 years in the WNBA and is the 12th-leading scorer in league history. Milton-Jones, now head coach at Pepperdine, initially tried to recruit her but backed off. “I knew she was going to be too talented for our level,” she said. “Her college career, I think, is going to be stellar. She has a high IQ and a vast array of abilities in her skill set that Tara VanDerveer will use to the maximum. “She won’t blow you away with her speed and explosiveness, but she will fill up the stats sheet. They have a great class coming in. They’ll still be Stanford but with a little more pop and pizzazz than they’ve had.” In addition to Jones, the class will include five-star players Ashten Prechtel, a 6-5 post from Colorado; Fran Belibi, a 6-1 forward from Colorado; and Hannah Jump, a 5-11 point guard from Pinewood-Los Altos. Haley hopes to follow Milton-Jones into the Olympics and the WNBA. Last summer, Haley helped the U.S. Under-17 team roll to the World Cup title in Minsk, Belarus. Her parents work together, training teachers in classroom management and professional development. “Academically, they always expected me to give my best,” she said. “They said, ‘Give your best 100 percent of the time, and then whatever the result is, we’re proud of you. If it’s not where you want it to be, we’ll find you some help, so you can get where you want to be.’” Now and for the foreseeable future, Jones is exactly where she wants to be.Tracing the Bay Area’s most beautiful streams at peak flow is a special way to imagine the trip that each drop of water takes from skyline to sea. On the Peninsula Skyline, the headwaters of Pescadero Creek start as little Peters Creek, a  beautiful brook that ripples through Long Ridge Open Space Preserve. In the East Bay hills, Alameda Creek forms as a small stream in remote Sunol Regional Wilderness, gathers strength in a series of miniature waterfalls in Little Yosemite, and eventually flows through Niles Canyon and into South San Francisco Bay. In Marin, a saturated aquifer on the north flank of Mount Tamalpais pumps water into a ravine that flows into Lagunitas Lake, routes through other smaller lakes and feeder creeks, eventually depositing in Tomales Bay. The series of storms in the past month recharged dozens of creeks across the region; many feed into these three major streams. The best way to see the transformation is to trace them out, from top to bottom. To put the strength of this winter in perspective, in Marin, the gauge at Lake Lagunitas hit 45 inches this week. At the same date last year, it was at 19.64. This winter’s totals at Lagunitas are 85 percent of the average annual rainfall, 52.56 inches, measured through June 30. All the creeks are pouring down the ravines and canyons like fountains. Here’s how to see it best. S.F. Peninsula Pescadero Creek:  The first trickles start on the flank of the highest spot in San Mateo County, an unsigned hill in Long Ridge Open Space, and gather to form a brook, Peters Creek, which flows through a gorgeous ravine under a hardwood canopy. Peters Creek then runs down into the Bay Area’s “Lost World,” a remote redwood grove in Portola Redwoods State Park, and then merges with the headwaters of Pescadero Creek. Here it gains strength and streams downhill amid second-growth redwoods adjacent to  Haul Road and into Pescadero Creek County Park and Memorial County Park (and the trailhead for hiking, mountain biking). Ultimately, the stream widens, slows and runs into the Pescadero Valley and to the coast. It forms Pescadero Lagoon, a gorgeous marsh with habitat for shorebirds, waterfowl and raptors, and then runs under the Highway 1 Bridge and breaks through to the ocean. In the process, Pescadero Creek passes through six parks, preserves, marshes and beaches with public access. Each mile of the way, Pescadero Creek transforms the surrounding landscape.

Marin County Lagunitas Creek:  The trip starts at pretty Lagunitas Lake, just 22 acres, on the flank of Mount Tamalpais. Lagunitas spills into 140-acre Bon Tempe, with trails at both Lagunitas and Bon Tempe. In turn, Bon Tempe then pours into Alpine Lake (the trailhead for the Cataract Trail starts beyond the dam). At Alpine Dam, the trailhead for the Kent Pump Trail is on the right, where you get a pretty view of a stepped cascade on the backside of the dam. The trail is a service road that makes for a mountain-bike route that is routed to upper Kent Lake. Below Kent Dam, access is off Sir Francis Drake. Near the Leo T. Cronin Fish Viewing Area, a trail/road runs along the outfall flows from Peters Dam. Downstream, along Sir Francis Drake, the Ink Wells provide a gorgeous series of pool-and-drops, and then gather power as they flow into Samuel P. Taylor State Park. Redwoods tower overhead on the Stream Trail. If you trace the river out, it runs  to the southern end of Tomales Bay, with access at White House Pool, where you can kayak into the adjacent Giacomini Wetlands for bird watching.

East Bay hills Alameda Creek:  Top to bottom, there might be no stream in the Bay Area that goes through more dramatic changes than Alameda Creek. It starts in the remote Sunol Regional Wilderness, where the saturated aquifer pumps pristine water into ravines, which join and then pour through a small canyon called Little Yosemite. Though it doesn’t look anything like Yosemite Valley, at high water, the creek surges through the rocky gorge. It’s a gorgeous sight, great for photographs; 1.8-mile round trip. The creek then descends to Niles and beyond to Niles Canyon (a fish ladder is under construction near Mission Boulevard), where Highway 84 runs alongside. It then widens into more of a channel and slows. From Niles Community Park, the Alameda Creek Regional Trail (there will be a rolling closure this week for maintenance) edges each side of Alameda Creek: an unpaved route for walking, hiking and horseback riding on the north side, and a paved pathway for cycling and jogging on the south side. The paved route for cyclists is 12 miles one way and passes the Kaiser water pits, has bridged access to Quarry Lakes, and extends west to Coyote Hills Regional Park and the shore of the South Bay.

Saturday night brings the usual drama of a Warriors-Houston matchup, with a couple of intriguing twists. At the start of Friday night’s play, the Rockets were just 1½ games clear of the eighth and final playoff spot. That’s just how crazy the Western Conference has become. A more immediate concern is the Rockets’ crusade against officiating. After fouling out of Thursday night’s loss to the Lakers at Staples Center,  James Harden  launched an attack on   Scott Foster , one of the NBA’s most prominent referees and likely to be a fixture during the postseason. “Scott Foster, man he’s ... I never really talk about officiating or anything like that, but  just rude and arrogant,” Harden said. “Last year in the postseason in the Western Conference Finals (against the Warriors), I think he officiated a couple of our games. It’s just lingering. And it’s something that has to be looked at. For sure it’s personal. For sure. I don’t think he should be able to officiate our games any more, honestly.” Teammate  Chris Paul , who also fouled out Thursday, has long had issues with Foster — and the Warriors also have some history. Foster called two technical fouls on  Shaun Livingston  during Game 4 of the 2016 playoff series against Portland, causing an ejection, and  Livingston thought it was personal . In all cases, players resent Foster because he doesn’t allow any blowback. “It’s one of those things where you can’t voice your opinion, you can’t have a conversation with someone that’s officiating the game” Harden said, “and you’re getting a tech. It’s pretty sad.” In reality, Foster didn’t cost the Rockets a victory Thursday night. They blew a 19-point third-quarter lead. Harden shot 2-for-10 from 3-point range, scored only four points in the fourth quarter and committed eight turnovers. Houston’s defense was typically dreadful, reflected in the numbers (27th in oponents’ field-goal percentage and 25th in points allowed per 100 possessions). And it’s the same old story with Harden — listed as questionable for Saturday’s game — who has scored at least 30 points in 32 straight games but gets damn little help when it really matters. “A lot of people talk about how much he dribbles,” TNT analyst  Chris Webber  said Thursday night. “But who else on this team can get their own shot? You have to trust your teammates before you win.” Added  Charles Barkley : As opposed to the Warriors, who can overcome a superstar’s off-night, “James Harden can’t have   bad games.” Harden hadn’t fouled out since December  2017 (Foster was the lead official that night), and that’s a matter of spirited discussion throughout the league. Harden consistently uses his right arm to push away defenders when he attacks the basket, and he’s rarely called on it. A more pertinent issue against the Lakers was charging; that resulted in Harden’s fifth and sixth fouls as he barged into  Kyle Kuzma , then  LeBron James . You wonder, though, if Harden made a serious mistake in calling out Foster. Such comments don’t play well in the officials’ community, and it’s possible that Harden’s tactics will be more carefully scrutinized as the regular season gives way to the playoffs. That’s if Houston even   the playoffs. This is a healthy (finally) but deeply flawed team that can ill afford being embarrassed by the Warriors on Saturday night. Thrifty or smart? Marwin Gonzalez  wasn’t a big star with the Astros, but as he  agreed to a free-agent deal with Minnesota, several Houston players said they’ll miss his winning nature and versatility. Was he too costly for the Giants at $10.5 million per season? Probably so, and they were able to  sign a player with similar stats,  Yangervis Solarte , for  $1.75 million. The progress of both players will be worth following. ... The Dodgers would love to place this in the “no big deal” category, but they had to be concerned when  Clayton Kershaw  asked for some time off Thursday after complaining that his arm “didn’t feel right” during a bullpen session ... When  Manny Machado  signed his $300 million deal with San Diego, commissioner  Rob Manfred  jumped all over critics of the free-agent system, saying, “In some ways I feel it’s much ado about nothing.” But the system isn’t “fine,” as Manfred and others have claimed. Machado was a free agent for   and a number of other top players (notably  Bryce   Harper ) are in limbo. Meanwhile, teams are held hostage as they try to guess their way through roster moves and sizing up division rivals. I’d suggest a signing window running through Dec.31. Traditionally, the majority of big-name signings took place before Christmas. ... Machado exposed his occasional lack of hustle during last year’s postseason with the Dodgers, even admitting it’s not his style. He’d do well to run out those ground balls, hard, in the Padres’ spring-training games. He can’t show up proving all that negativity was for real. As you watch the Oscars on Sunday night, remember that  Mahershala Ali , a best supporting actor nominee for his role in “Green Book,” was a  standout basketball player  at Mt. Eden-Hayward and St. Mary’s, at that time using his given last name of  Gilmore . A 6-foot-3 guard, he was known for his tough defense and all-out play. ... Upon his election to the Hall of Fame,  Mike Mussina  said he couldn’t choose between the Orioles and Yankees as to which logo would appear on his plaque, thus leaving the area blank. Maybe he should bring a Stanford cap to the induction. For all of that school’s success over the years, Mussina will be the first Cardinal to be enshrined at Cooperstown. ... The baseball community lost a pillar of excellence and integrity Thursday when the Boston Globe’s  Nick Carfado  died of an apparent embolism at 62. Like so many in the business, I never missed his Sunday notes column. Just two weeks ago he did his annual ranking of major-league managers and showed deep respect for  Bruce Bochy , ranking him fourth (behind  Alex Cora ,  Bob Melvin  and  Terry Francona ) and noting that Bochy handled the Giants’ down years “with so much class and dignity. His methods are timeless. Maybe he’s one of the last of the old-time managers, but he’d be successful in any era.”The hopes and dreams of a franchise and its fans might rest this offseason not in the front office, but in an East Bay rehab clinic, where Buster Posey has been healing and strengthening his body after  a right hip operation in August . Although attention has been focused on talent the Giants’ new leadership hopes to acquire, the real offensive rainmaker in 2019 could be the Giants’ longest-tenured position player, on the theory that he will regain much of the prowess at the plate he lost to a hip injury that probably predated the 2018 season. The last time Posey had a significant injury, when Scott Cousins mangled his left leg in a 2011 home-plate collision, Posey returned in 2012 and won a batting title and the National League MVP award. There is a major difference: Posey was 25 then and will be 32 next season, with a lot more tough miles on that chassis. Nobody should expect Posey to approach his career-high .336 average and .957 OPS from that championship season. But maybe the post-surgery strength work can pay a similar dividend and revive some of Posey’s power, which was all but nonexistent in a five-homer 2018 season. President of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi declared at the winter meetings that he still views Posey as a franchise player who should not be pigeonholed as the opposite-field slap hitter he became last year. “I think he’s a middle-order hitter. Definitely,” Zaidi said. Manager Bruce Bochy concurred, saying, “I think this surgery has given all of us, including Buster, a little bit more hope on the hitting side, that now he’s going to be able to fire those hips like he used to. He just wasn’t able to do it. “As you get older, especially for a catcher, it’s hard to say, ‘Well, he’s going to get back to what he was at 23, 24.’ But I think he’ll get very close to what he normally does with the bat.” The Giants under Zaidi continue to maintain that the club is best served by Posey catching, rather than moving to first base, because he is so good at handling a pitching staff, receiving the ball and throwing out runners. Posey’s body surely would hold up better if he plays the infield rather than catches, which can wear down even a younger hitter’s body and neutralize his pop. Home runs are but one measure of power, but still instructive. Over the past three seasons, Posey has hit 31 home runs, 24 of them before July 1, including all five in 2018. Compare that with his MVP season in 2012, when Posey hit 14 of his 24 homers after July 1. Posey slugged over 1.000 each month in July, August and September. His highest slugging percentage in any month over the past three seasons was .600, in May 2017. The Giants, realistically, hope Posey can fall somewhere in the middle in 2019 without debilitating hip pain. Zaidi is counting on more power from Posey — without the catcher monkeying with his line-drive swing. As the clock winds down on 2018, The Chronicle profiles 10 influencers who will shape the Bay Area sports landscape in 2019. “He is such a great player and great hitter that you wouldn’t want him to adjust his approach to hit for more power,” Zaidi said, adding he expects the numbers to rise organically if Posey can use his lower half properly while swinging. “The same offensive profile with more power would be great,” he said. Posey rarely uses injuries as an excuse. In fact, he  hates even to reveal his ailments and said his hip issues would have remained a secret much longer had he not been voted into the All-Star Game and required to explain why he had to back out. Still,  his hip injury was hard to mask, and at times, he acknowledged the link to his declining numbers. “It’s been kind of something I’ve pushed through and played through,” Posey told The Chronicle when the newspaper first reported he would need surgery. Once the surgery was announced, Posey said, “From everything I’ve researched and heard, the outcome is generally pretty good and I can get back the range in my hip that’s vital for hitting and squatting.” Bochy has spoken to Posey and saw him at Willie McCovey’s Nov. 8 memorial service. Although Posey reported he was encouraged, Bochy admitted that any early analysis now is a “pretty tough readout.” Posey’s maintenance will be more critical than ever as Bochy assesses when to rest him or play him at first base, when to push him behind the plate for defense or back off to get a fresher bat. “My hope is that he’s going to be able to maintain his strength during the course of a season, and not just a season, a game,” Bochy said. “Last year, you could see it catch up with him in the sixth, seventh inning where he wore down. So I think he’s excited about that.”As far as potential rivalries go, Kings-Warriors boasts shockingly few highlights. Perhaps the most memorable one — Klay Thompson’s 37-point quarter in January 2015 — hardly reflects well on Sacramento. That soon might change, though. Thanks to a promising young nucleus and an up-tempo playing style, the Kings have emerged as one of the NBA’s intriguing story lines, competing for a playoff seed years earlier than many anticipated. In escaping Oracle Arena on Thursday night with a 125-123 win over Sacramento, Golden State emboldened those eager for a Northern California basketball rivalry. The Kings  led much of the second half before the Warriors wore  down Sacramento in the fourth quarter. “A win is a win for us coming out of the break,” Stephen Curry said. “It was a good feeling, but we know that we can play better.” When DeMarcus Cousins hit a layup less than a minute into the fourth quarter, Golden State took its first lead since early in the second. The two teams traded blows until Buddy Hield drained a 3-pointer with 10.3 seconds left to cut Sacramento’s deficit to 125-123. After Andre Iguodala missed both of his free-throw tries with 7.4 seconds remaining, Hield got one final shot, only to bypass an open 3-pointer and airball a contested 12-foot jumper as the final buzzer sounded. The Warriors, in their first game back from the All-Star break, won for the 17th time in their past 19 games. “This is the fourth game that we deserved to lose against this team,” Kevin Durant said. To eke out a victory over its neighbors 88 miles to the northeast, Golden State needed dazzling performances from Durant (28 points, nine rebounds, seven blocks) and Curry (36 points, seven assists). In his first game against Sacramento — the team for which he played his first 6½ NBA seasons — since joining the Warriors last summer, Cousins oscillated between flashes of dominance and rage, posting 17 points, 10 rebounds and five fouls (including a Flagrant 1) in 27 minutes. Golden State  committed only four turnovers in the second half after piling up 11 in the first. The difference came beyond the arc, where the Warriors shot 19-for-46 to the Kings’ 10-for-33. Along the way, a capacity crowd dotted with yellow, blue and purple offered a peek at a possible playoff environment. Golden State sits 2½ games ahead of Denver for the Western Conference’s top seed. Meanwhile, Sacramento is just 1½ games behind the Clippers for the West’s eighth seed. A potential first-round matchup surely would help jolt a long-dormant rivalry out of its slumber. Since the Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985, they have not faced Golden State in the playoffs. “Every time we play (the Kings), it’s high-energy, beautiful basketball,” Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said. “They’re tough to guard. They put a lot of pressure on you. Who knows what’s going to happen down the stretch? A lot of really good teams battling for the playoffs, but they’re really good.” When Sacramento was challenging the Lakers for supremacy in the West, the Warriors were mired in a 12-year playoff drought. Over the past half-decade, as Golden State blossomed into a dynasty, the Kings slogged through a lengthy rebuild. When Sacramento played the Warriors at Oracle Arena on Nov. 24, it was the first meeting in which both teams had winning records. That has been quite a waste of a promising rivalry. In addition to touting diehard fan bases and regional bragging rights, Kings-Warriors has plenty of personal ties. Sacramento principal owner Vivek Ranadive is a former Warriors minority owner who has tried to follow Golden State’s championship blueprint since taking over the Kings in 2013. Cousins, perhaps the best player in the league to have yet to play in the postseason, left a polarizing legacy in Sacramento when he was traded to New Orleans two years ago. Sacramento forward Harrison Barnes was essentially replaced by Durant after an ugly showing with the Warriors in the 2016 NBA Finals. In its four meetings this season with Golden State, Sacramento has lost by a combined 12 points. Testing the Warriors in the first round might exorcise those memories. “I like how fast they play, and they shoot a lot of threes,” Durant said. “They’re just lacking experience, in my opinion. They’ll be a team to be reckoned with pretty soon.”The Raiders are still open to playing in Oakland in 2019. Scott McKibben, executive director of the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority, said Tuesday that Coliseum officials have met with the Raiders about the team playing a final season in Oakland before relocating to Las Vegas in 2020. McKibben described the meetings as “meaningful and productive.” In December, the Raiders withdrew from a tentative $7.5 million lease agreement at the Coliseum for the 2019 season, a day after the city of Oakland filed a federal lawsuit against the Raiders and the NFL seeking millions in damages over the team’s impending move to Las Vegas. McKibben told The Chronicle on Tuesday: “That is still the deal on the table.” The Raiders did not respond to requests for comment. The team’s re-engaging with Coliseum officials comes under a soft deadline from the NFL for a stadium resolution. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said before the Super Bowl that he expected a decision “soon” on where the Raiders will play home games as the league needs to start making its 2019 schedule. Goodell said he believed owner Mark Davis would prefer to stay in the Bay Area next season. The Raiders have explored other options, including engaging in talks to play at Oracle Park, the home of the Giants. A deal there would require approval from the NFL, and calls into question whether the 49ers would need to waive their territorial rights to San Francisco. The Raiders also could share Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara with the 49ers for a season, although it is understood that is not Davis’ preference. A return to the Coliseum — where the Raiders  played  from 1966 through ’81 and again since 1995 — would provide familiarity, especially as the team is still expected to operate out of its Alameda headquarters next season. Head coach Jon Gruden is among those who have said he would prefer the team plays in Oakland in 2019. Under their previous tentative agreement, the Raiders would have paid $7.5 million to play at the Coliseum in 2019 and $9.5 million in 2020 if their Las Vegas stadium was not completed in time. The team’s current lease, on which it paid $3.5 million per season, expires Wednesday. Larry Reid, the Oakland City Council member who represents the area, said the lease issue will be discussed Friday in a closed session meeting of the city-county Coliseum Authority Board, of which he is vice chair. Reid said McKibben has had talks with Raiders executives and “we’ll see where that takes us.” McKibben said he does not expect a deal to be reached by Friday but there could be resolution in the coming weeks. The NFL typically does not release its final schedule until mid-April. The Raiders will host seven regular-season games in 2019, also playing one designated “home” game in London against the Bears.SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — To the extent a roster candidate can help his cause before the exhibition games, catcher  Aramis Garcia  has impressed the right person as he bids to become  Buster Posey ’s backup. President of baseball operations  Farhan Zaidi  heard manager  Bruce Bochy  rave about the way the ball has jumped off Garcia’s bat in practice, then saw it for himself. “That’s been a real revelation to me not having seen him up close,” Zaidi said. “The power has been really impressive, and he’s a guy I could see taking on a bigger role, especially if Buster is limited early in the season.” Garcia’s ability to play first base, too, helps his cause as the Giants try to cobble a versatile 25-man roster. He will have a lot of experienced competition from  Steven Vogt ,  Cameron Rupp  and  Rene Rivera . And, hey, if the baseball thing does not work out, there’s always Mavericks. Although Garcia spent part of the offseason working with instructors to tweak his swing and improve his catching mechanics, he also relaxed on a surfboard while visiting a cousin in Newport Beach who works for the Billabong surf shop. “Relaxed” might not be the right word. “I was just trying to steer clear of the pier,” Garcia said. “I’ve seen plenty of videos of guys going straight into the big posts.” Relax, Giants fans. Garcia’s cousin kept the 26-year-old in more “mellow spots” at Blackies and State Park beaches, although he did wipe out a few times. “It’s definitely something I want to keep doing, for sure,” said Garcia, who spent the winter mainly in Arizona but plans to return home to South Florida next offseason. That is not a surfing decision. Garcia’s family is there, but he did say, “You can’t beat the water. It’s very therapeutic.” Reliever added:  The Giants added to their area of biggest strength by agreeing to terms with former San Diego and Seattle reliever  Nick Vincent  on a minor-league deal. Vincent was in camp Thursday. The  right-hander has appeared in at least 60 games in each the past three seasons. He took a step back in 2018 when his ERA rose to 3.99 from 3.20 the year before; some of his peripheral numbers were better, particularly strikeouts per nine innings. They rose from 7 to 8.9 year over year.Near Donner Summit, crews at Donner Ski Ranch and other ski areas across the Sierra Nevada this week have been digging out their lifts from deep snow. After another big snow dump Wednesday, the hope at Donner is to clear the snow in time to open ski lifts and runs for the weekend, said resort co-owner Janet Tuttle. “We’re buried in snow,” she said. “We’re trying to dig out.” Donner Ski Ranch isn’t the only resort anticipating the three-day Presidents Day weekend, potentially the biggest ski weekend of the year. The National Weather Service posted avalanche warnings for Wednesday night, when a short period of warm temperatures could mean rain, not snow. The forecast seems to change by the hour, but most models call for a return to cold weather and snow Friday and Saturday, intermittent show showers Sunday, and cold temperatures Monday with plenty of sunshine. That would mean refreshed surfaces daily on the runs at ski areas throughout the state. If there is a chance to dig out Friday, it’s possible that everything — all lifts, all runs — will be open all weekend. The outlook is the same everywhere across Tahoe and the Sierra Nevada. North of Lake Tahoe, Northstar California opened all 100 runs this week. On the south shore, Heavenly opened all 96 of its runs and, with less formidable weather in the forecast, is expecting to operate all 28 of its lifts for the weekend. An hour to the south, Kirkwood reported a 350-inch season snowfall and opened 100 percent of its terrain. Mammoth Mountain in the eastern Sierra is racking up remarkable snowfall totals. At its 11,053-foot summit, Mammoth has recorded 454 inches of snow this season, the most of any ski area in the country. That’s more than 37 feet — and does not include Wednesday’s additional blast. “We’ll be open for skiing through Fourth of July,” said Tim LeRoy at Mammoth. Mammoth isn’t the only spot with mind-boggling accumulations. Eleven ski areas have reported more than 300-inch totals: Mammoth, Squaw Valley (396), Homewood (355), Sugar Bowl and Boreal (354 each), Kirkwood (350), Dodge Ridge (331), Alpine Meadows (326), Sierra at Tahoe (319), Bear Valley (323), Soda Springs (315). A 500-inch-plus winter is within range at many areas. To put it in perspective, consider the scene at Dodge Ridge (off Highway 108 above Sonora and near Pinecrest). Its 27-plus feet of snow are more than 130 percent of normal for the entire winter. An estimated 150 inches fell in the first 10 days of February. And the amount of snow is only half the story. Surface conditions at many areas are projected to be ideal throughout the weekend. The forecast of cold temperatures Friday means fresh snowfall has a chance to be light and sugary. On runs that are packed and groomed, it gives rise to sugarlike corduroy that many think is the perfect surface for skiing and boarding. On runs that are not groomed, it can pile up in deep powder.

Note: Each ski area was contacted for this report, best available information reported; as weather allows, many ski areas will open more terrain for this weekend; prices often fluctuate with dates, with discounts sometimes available with advance purchase. The flip side is you have to be ready for the cold. At South Lake Tahoe, daily highs are not expected to crest much over 30 degrees all weekend. Morning lows could be in the teens, and in some localized microclimates, under 10 at dawn. The Truckee office of the California Highway Patrol said that drivers should be ready for winter snow conditions on the highways, and that chain controls are likely when temperatures drop and snow returns Friday and Saturday. Chains would be required on the drive axle of two-wheel drives, or mud and snow tread (labeled M&S) for all-wheel and 4-wheel-drive vehicles.MESA, Ariz. - Despite poor weather forecasts for Thursday afternoon, the A’s and Mariners will attempt to get in at least a portion of their Cactus League opener at Hohokam Stadium It was widely believed that the game would be called early because of daylong rain expected in the Phoenix area, but a break in the weather at the scheduled noon Pacific start time changed plans. There is also rain in Friday’s forecast, and the A’s and Mariners have a short spring training this season because of their season-opening series in Japan next month. That accelerated schedule makes losing two games to rain potentially problematic. A’s Cactus League opener tomorrow but it’s highly likely to be rained out:  pic.twitter.com/aRfzTNIBIT Paul Blackburn, who is from Brentwood, is scheduled to start Thursday’s game, with Frankie Montas also scheduled to pitch. Daniel Mengden is the scheduled starter Friday. If either of the games is washed out or if pitchers pegged for later innings don’t get in their work, they’d head to the A’s minor-league Fitch Park facility to throw simulated innings. All the A’s spring games will be broadcast on the team’s new flagship station, KTRB (860 AM).When Kristine Anigwe picked up her third foul midway through the third quarter Friday night, Asha Thomas grabbed the All-America center and repeatedly shouted: “It’s time.” Apparently, it was time for the 5-foot-4 Thomas to take over the game. Cal’s “Little General” used the next four minutes to drill three 3-pointers and spark a 69-60 comeback victory against No. 17 Arizona State that quite possibly saved a Bears’ season that had been spiraling. “I said this week that we were going to change and we were going to get it done. That’s simply because of the belief I have in these players and the leadership they’ve shown,” head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. “This felt like an NCAA Tournament game for a lot of reasons. Arizona State is so darn good, and also because we’re battling for everything that we want to achieve. This is who we are. This is who we can be.” The Bears (15-11, 6-9 Pac-12), once 9-0 and No. 1 in RPI, had lost five in a row and were trying to balance on the tournament bubble before Thomas put up  18 points on 4-for-7 3-point shooting and played 38-plus minutes without a turnover in her penultimate game at Haas Pavilion. Team Conf. All Oregon 13-2 24-3 Stanford 12-3 22-4 Oregon State 12-3 22-5 UCLA 10-5 17-10 Arizona State 9-5 18-7 Utah 8-7 19-7 Arizona 7-8 17-9 Cal 6-9 15-11 USC 5-10 15-11 Washington St. 4-11 9-17 Colorado 2-13 12-14 Washington 1-13 8-18 On a night when Cal wore pink jerseys as part of the “Play4Kay” series aimed at raising awareness for breast cancer, the Bears reversed a trend of losing single-digit games. They got Anigwe’s 26th straight double-double (20 points, 15 rebounds), took Kianna Ibis out of her game and overcame the Sun Devils’ superior depth by committing only seven turnovers. “This is a signature win that is so meaningful to me as a coach, because we had a hard time coming back from that (L.A.) trip,” Gottlieb said. “The thing I could always go back to amid the disappointment was my belief in this group.” Arizona State (18-7, 9-5) got minutes from 12 players and points from nine, but little of the scoring was from Ibis. The senior forward went 1-for-11 after coming into the game averaging a team-best 17 points per game in Pac-12 play. The Sun Devils had won five straight and beat Cal 62-61 on Jan. 13 in a game never separated by more than six points, with 18 lead changes and 13 ties. It looked like the rematch might never be that close. Cal led for only 43 seconds in the first half and trailed by as many as 12 points on a night when the Bears, usually dominant in rebounding, struggled to secure defensive boards. Arizona State had six offensive rebounds in the opening six minutes. Anigwe, the nation’s leading rebounder, didn’t pull in her first board until only 1½ minutes remained in the first quarter. She opened the game 0-for-5 from the floor and didn’t make her third field goal until the Bears trailed 30-18 midway through the second quarter. Thomas’ three 3-pointers in a third-quarter span of 3:49 changed the tide of the game. Her second 3 during the run gave Cal a 38-35 lead - its first since it was 5-4 - and her third 3 extended the Bears’ advantage to 45-37 with 2½ minutes left in the third quarter. “To be honest, I don’t even remember (the exchange with Anigwe), but I know for sure that me and her want this bad for our team,” Thomas said. “It’s not just us that make the spark go. It takes everybody, and it’s time to grind out this game and finish this.”MESA, Ariz. — Since Day 1 of spring training, A’s manager  Bob Melvin  has said that  Daniel Mengden  looks like a man on a mission. “He’s come in with an attitude of, ‘I want to prove myself this year, that I can be a starter every fifth day,’” Melvin said. “We think he has the ability to do that. He’s got the right attitude and he came in in really great shape.” Mengden, who turned in strong work as the “second guy in” after opener  Liam Hendriks   in September, is gunning for a job actually starting games this season. With potentially two spots open in the rotation, he might have a leg up on the competition after putting up a 2.52 ERA and .180 opponents’ average  in his final six outings last season. He just needs to stay healthy, and he’s trying to address that. After missing time with foot injuries each of the past two seasons (plus in college), Mengden dropped 15 pounds this winter. For the past four or five years, Mengden, 26, has done carb-conscious intermittent fasting, and he did so more strictly over the winter. Mengden doesn’t eat in the morning and has only protein and vegetables for lunch followed by a slightly more lenient dinner. He follows that plan even more religiously now, with the exception of day games — if he’s pitching a day game, he usually will eat an omelet. “We talked about it and thought if I got a little leaner, it might help,” said Mengden, who is scheduled to start Friday’s game against the Mariners in Peoria, Ariz. “It was mostly being aware of my diet. Nothing too fancy. It’s not very fun.” Open and shut:  The A’s Cactus League opener at Hohokam Stadium was wiped out by rain after an inning and a half with Seattle leading 5-0. Starter  Paul Blackburn  allowed three hits and two runs in one inning and reliever  Jerry Blevins  allowed three hits, a walk and three runs, but those numbers won’t count in the spring training statistics. “Coming in here, you’re aware of what the weather could be,” Blackburn said. “As a starter, you’ve got to block that out and go about your business and prepare for that 1:05 start no matter what the conditions are. I’m actually happy with how everything went.” Blackburn said he’s working on keeping his four-seam fastball off the middle of the plate and he liked the results Thursday. “Well, we have our feet wet now, literally,” Melvin said after the game was called. Melvin noted that the A’s got nice plays in the field from new second baseman  Jurickson Profar , first baseman  Matt Olson  and, starting at third,  Chad Pinder . Briefly:   Matt Chapman  resumed baseball activities after being out sick Wednesday. ...  Mike Fiers  threw simulated innings at Fitch Park on Thursday. ... Top pitching prospect  Jesus Luzardo  also is on the list to appear in Friday’s game, with relievers  Ryan Buchter  and Hendriks, weather permitting. ...  Chris Bassitt  is listed as Saturday’s probable starter, with All-Star closer  Blake Treinen  also scheduled to go in the game against the White Sox at Hohokam.The top 10 section title games, ranked in the order that Bay Area basketball fans should enjoy Friday or Saturday: 1. Pinewood-Los Altos Hills girls (24-2) vs. Mitty (24-2) at Santa Clara University, 7 p.m. Friday:  Fans have  pointed to this possible Central Coast Section Open Division matchup between two of the nation’s top teams. Mitty won the CCS crown last year over Pinewood 76-62, but the Panthers came back to win the rematch 78-67 in triple overtime for the Northern Calfiornia Open title. Stanford signees Haley Jones (Mitty) and Hannah Jump (Pinewood) lead their  teams. Mitty is No. 2 in the MaxPreps national computer rankings and Pinewood is No. 9. 2. Sacred Heart Cathedral boys (12-14) vs. Bellarmine (20-6) at SCU, 8:30 p.m. Friday:  This CCS Open title game is a  surprise matchup as the Irish are the first eight seed to reach the final. SHC has caught fire after a 3-11 West Catholic Athletic League season. Bellarmine figured to fizzle with injuries and illness but the Bells have pulled out  tough wins over St. Ignatius (57-54) and second-seeded Riordan (68-61 in overtime). 3. De La Salle-Concord (27-3) vs. James Logan-Union City (24-5) at St. Mary’s College, 8 p.m. Friday:  Most figured a rubber match between De La Salle and Dublin would come in this North Coast Section D1 title game, but Logan, specifically Tim Oldham, shocked the host Gaels  86-83. Oldham swished a desperation, turnaround 30-footer  at the buzzer to win it after Logan  squandered a seven-point lead in the final minute. 4. Moreau Catholic-Hayward boys (23-7) vs. Bishop O’Dowd-Oakland (21-7) at Dublin, 7 p.m. Saturday:  Two deep teams with longtime coaches — Moreau’s Frank Knight and O’Dowd’s Lou Richie — go for an NCS D2 championship. 5. Stuart Hall boys (27-4) vs. University (22-9) at Kezar Pavilion, 7 p.m. Saturday:  The trilogy between the Bay Counties League West rivals this season — top-seeded Stuart Hall has won by 6, 5 and 5 points — has been terrific. The second-seeded Red Devils are  looking for a different ending in this NCS D5 final. 6. Mission boys (20-9) vs. Lincoln (21-9) at Kezar Pavilion, 7 p.m. Friday:  Mission, two years after a  D3 state title, goes for its fifth straight San Francisco section title. Ben Knight, a 5-11 guard who averaged 4.9 points per game on that team,  now averages 19.8. Carl Jacobs has hit the ground running in his return to coaching  Lincoln, which is led by  guards Shakur Blaylock and Gabito Valdivia, who scored 23  each in a semifinal win over Washington. Mission won both regular-season meetings. 7. Carondelet-Concord (25-4) vs. Heritage-Brentwood (26-3) at St. Mary’s College, 6 p.m. Friday:  Heritage has been knocking on the door but has not won an NCS title. It will be a tall order to beat  top D1 seed Carondelet and 6-3 Washington-bound post Ali Bamberger. 8. Branson-Ross boys (28-2) vs. Fortuna (29-1) at College of Marin, 7 p.m. Friday:  The records for the  teams in this NCS D4 final say it all. 9. Miramonte-Orinda girls (27-2) vs. Bishop O’Dowd (19-9) at Dublin, 5 p.m. Saturday:  If this one matches last year’s NCS D2 championship — a 75-71 Bishop O’Dowd win — fans are in for a treat. 10. Campolindo-Moraga boys (22-6) vs. Salesian-Richmond (30-0) at St. Mary’s College, 7:30 p.m. Saturday:  For the third straight year, these teams meet for the NCS D3 title.  The Cougars have played the Pride tough. Salesian is ranked fifth in the country by MaxPreps.High school basketball doesn’t get much better than Wednesday; section semifinals  abound. Here are the 10 best games to attend: San Leandro boys (24-4) at De La Salle-Concord (26-3), 7 p.m.:  In this North Coast Section Division 1 game, San Leandro coach Darnaryl Stamps wasn’t real pleased with the fourth seed, especially compared with De La Salle’s No. 1. His team, loaded with talent and size, led by 6-foot-7 forward Keshad Johnson, the Bay Area’s top senior recruit who has signed to San Diego State, will  play with a chip on its collective shoulder. De La Salle, led by 6-foot senior point guard Thomas Gregorios, is tested, having won five of its previous seven games by an average  of 4.1 points. Sacred Heart Cathedral boys (11-14) vs. Menlo-Atherton (22-3) at Independence-San Jose, 5:30 p.m.:  SHC’s record hurts the eyes, but the eighth-seeded Irish slayed top-seeded Mitty in a first-round Central Coast Section Open game and now  have their eyes on the only non-West Catholic Athletic League entry in the eight-team field. That gives both teams a Cinderella feel. Fourth-seeded M-A is after its 21st straight win. Bellarmine (19-6) vs. Riordan (18-7) at Independence, 7:30 p.m.:  The other CCS Open semifinal figured to unfold this way, though Bellarmine gritted out a first-round win over St. Ignatius despite missing two starters to injury. Riordan won both regular-season games, 54-42 and 63-52. The Bells simply had little answer for the dynamic, quick junior backcourt of Bryce Monroe (16.8 points per game) and Je’Lani Clark (16 ppg). Bellarmine’s two leading scorers also are its starting guards, Quinn Denker and Kiran Kruse. Valley Christian girls (17-8) vs. Pinewood-Los Altos Hills (23-2) at Piedmont Hills-San Jose, 7:30 p.m.:  In this CCS Open semi, most fans want to see the rematch of top-seeded Mitty against Pinewood after the teams split two meetings last year — Mitty won the CCS title, but Pinewood turned it around with a triple-overtime victory for the Northern California Open title. Valley Christian, which lost  to Mitty by just 10, is capable of pulling the upset with Fallon Dexheimer (13.8 ppg) and Nyah Willis (13.7). St. Ignatius, which faces Mitty in the other semifinal, has been playing  well, but lost to Mitty by 19 and 44 points. James Logan-Union City boys (23-5) at Dublin (25-4), 7 p.m.:  This D1 semifinal features two fearless teams who love to go up and down the court. Don’t be surprised if the teams combine for at least 150 points. Logan boasts the fantastic guard tandem of cousins Brett and Brahjon Thompson, who combined for 86 points in two NCS wins. Dublin has one of the best scorers in Northern California, junior guard Robby Beasley, who’s a three-year starter. Five others to watch:  Redwood-Larkspur boys at Bishop O’Dowd-Oakland, 7 p.m. (NCS D2); St. Joseph Notre Dame-Alameda boys (19-6) vs. Salesian-Richmond (29-0) at Albany, 7 p.m. (NCS D3 boys); St. Patrick-St. Vincent-Vallejo boys (20-10) at Campolindo-Moraga (21-6), 7 p.m. (NCS D3 boys); St. Joseph Notre Dame girls (21-6) at Cardinal Newman-Santa Rosa (24-4), 7 p.m.; San Ramon Valley-Danville girls (26-3) at Heritage-Brentwood (25-3), 7 p.m. (NCS D1). Tuesday’s games Lincoln girls 62, Washington 53:  In a San Francisco Section semifinal game at Kezar Pavilion, Lily Donovan had 18 points and 17 rebounds, and Angelina Jimenez added 17 points, including three 3-pointers as the Mustangs (17-13) moved into Friday’s  championship game against Lowell (16-8), a 67-53 winner over Mission (12-9). Washington (15-11) got 20 points from Clarissa Li. King’s Academy 62, Jefferson-Daily City 51:  In CCS D4 quarterfinal play, sophomore Noah Short had 34 points for fifth-seeded King’s Academy (19-7) at fourth-seeded Jefferson (17-9), which led 9-0 and 17-10 after the first quarter. A 20-6 fourth-quarter run by King’s put away the game.No. 5 Kentucky got the strong start it sought against No. 1 Tennessee and for a moment was blowing out the Volunteers. Most important was that the Wildcats finished off the Vols on a national stage, just what they needed days after letting one slip away. PJ Washington scored 23 points, Keldon Johnson added 19 and host Kentucky beat Tennessee 86-69 Saturday night to end the Volunteers’ school-record, 19-game winning streak. The Wildcats used a 25-7 surge over a little more than seven minutes for a 62-38 lead, providing a cushion that withstood the Volunteers’ 13-0 spurt soon after that cut the advantage in half. Kentucky maintained a double-digit lead to win the highly anticipated matchup of top-five schools. Kentucky (21-4, 10-2 SEC) also avoided a second consecutive conference loss to stay within reach of co-leader Tennessee (23-2, 11-1), which hadn’t lost since Nov. 23 to No. 2 Kansas. “It shows everybody that we can still play with great teams in this league and also in the country,” said Washington, who scored Kentucky’s first seven points and finished 9-for-12 from the field for his seventh 20-point effort in eight games. Tyler Herro had 15 points and 13 rebounds as Kentucky beat Tennessee 39-26 on the glass. It was a big improvement from Tuesday’s 73-71 home loss to No. 19 LSU, a game decided on a last-second tip-in the Wildcats thought was basket interference. However, Kentucky played a big role with breakdowns and questionable shots that let the Tigers rally and eventually win the game. The Wildcats rebounded with an effort that was thorough in many phases. They outscored the Vols 36-20 in the paint and edged them 17-14 in second-chance points. Instead of letting Tennessee expand its one encouraging run, Kentucky did what it had to do to keep a double-digit advantage. “I hit them right after the game with LSU and said, ‘Hey, that was a tough loss,’” Kentucky coach John Calipari said. “But you know, we needed it. We need to go back to what we were, and sometimes you’ve got to get knocked in the head to know that.” #2 Duke 94, North Carolina State 78:  RJ Barrett had Duke’s first triple-double in 13 years, finishing with 23 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists as the host Blue Devils (23-2, 11-1 ACC) beat the Wolfpack (18-8, 6-7). Zion Williamson scored 32 points on 12-of-16 shooting and Tre Jones added 13 in Duke’s ninth straight win. #3 Gonzaga 79, San Diego 67:  Rui Hachimura scored 16 of his 22 points in the second half and had 10 rebounds and the Bulldogs (25-2, 12-0 WCC) pulled away from the Toreros (16-11, 5-7) in the second half for their 16th straight victory. Zach Norvell Jr. added 18 points, Josh Perkins 15 and Brandon Clarke 14 for Gonzaga, which was held to 30 points in the first half but then scored 31 points in the first 9:59 of the second half to take control. #4 Virginia 60, Notre Dame 54:  Kyle Guy scored 22 points, De’Andre Hunter had 20 with 10 rebounds and the host Cavaliers (22-2, 10-2 ACC) withstood a late push by the Irish (13-12, 3-9). Hunter scored six points during a 9-0 run for Virginia after Notre Dame closed to within 45-44 with 8:12 left. #6 Michigan 65, #24 Maryland 52:  Charles Matthews scored 14 points and Iggy Brazdeikis added 13 to lead the Wolverines (23-3, 12-3 Big Ten) past the visiting Terrapins (19-7, 10-5). #7 Nevada 82, Wyoming 49:  Trey Porter scored 14 points, Jordan Caroline and Caleb Martin added 13 apiece, and the visiting Wolf Pack (24-1, 11-1 Mountain West) beat the Cowboys (6-19, 2-10) for their 10th straight win. #8 North Carolina 95, Wake Forest 57:  Cameron Johnson scored 27 points and the Tar Heels (20-5, 10-2) scored the game’s first 18 points against the Demon Deacons (9-15, 2-10) en route to their biggest-ever margin of victory in an ACC road game. #12 Purdue 76, Penn State 64:  Carsen Edwards scored 15 of his 21 points in the second half and Matt Haarms added a career-high 18 for the host Boilermakers (18-7, 11-3 Big Ten) against the Nittany Lions (9-16, 2-12). #14 Kansas 78, West Virginia 53:  Devon Dotson and K.J. Lawson each scored 15 points, and the Jayhawks (20-6, 9-4 Big 12) on their home court beat the depleted Mountaineers (10-15, 2-10), who started four freshmen. #15 Texas Tech, Baylor 61:  Jarrett Culver scored 18 points and Davide Moretti added 17 as the host Red Raiders (21-5, 9=4 Big 12) cruised past the Bears (16-9, 7-5). #16 Louisville 56, Clemson 55:  Christen Cunningham scored 16 of his 18 points in the second half to rally the Cardinals (18-8, 9-4 ACC), who hung on in the final seconds against the visiting Tigers (15-10, 5-7). #17 Florida State 69, Georgia Tech 47:  Christ Koumadje had 10 points and 12 rebounds as the visiting Seminoles (20-5, 8-4) topped the Yellow Jackets (11-15, 3-10) to tie a school record with their seventh straight ACC win. #23 Iowa State 78, #18 Kansas State 64:  Lindell Wigginton hit five 3-pointers and scored 23 points, Talen Horton-Tucker buried six 3s and had 20, and the Cyclones (19-6, 8-4 Big 12) won on the road against the Wildcats (19-6, 9-3). #19 LSU, Georgia 79:  In Athens, Ga., Tremont Waters scored 20 points, Ja’vonte Smart added 19 and the Tigers (21-4, 11-1 SEC) beat the Bulldogs (10-15, 1-11) for their fourth straight win. #21 Iowa 71, Rutgers 69:  Joe Wieskamp banked in a 3-pointer from the corner with less than a second to play in Piscataway, N.J., as the Hawkeyes (20-5, 9-5 Big Ten) topped the Scarlet Knights (12-13, 5-10) for their fourth straight win. #22 Virginia Tech 70, Pittsburgh 64:  Kerry Blackshear Jr. scored 29 points, Ahmed Hill added 14 and the Hokies (20-5, 9-4 ACC) beat the host Panthers (12-14, 2-11). Washington 72, Washington State 70:  Noah Dickerson tipped in a missed layup with 25 seconds remaining and the visiting Huskies (20-5, 11-1 Pac-12) topped the Beavers (10-15, 3-9). Arizona State 98, Utah 87:  Rob Edwards scored 28 points and Zylan Cheatham added 24 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Sun Devils (17-8, 8-5 Pac-12) past the host Utes (14-11, 8-5). Oregon State 72, Oregon 57:  Stephen Thompson Jr. had 22 points and the host Beavers (16-8, 8-4 Pac-12) beat the Ducks (15-10, 6-6). WOMEN #1 Baylor 87, Oklahoma 53:  Chloe Jackson scored 24 points and the host Bears (23-1, 13-0) rolled past the Sooners (6-18m 2-11) for their 36th consecutive Big 12 victory. BYU 66, #13 Gonzaga 64:  Shaylee Gonzales scored 19 points and Sara Hamson blocked two shots in the last minute as the visiting Cougars (20-6, 12-3 WCC) ended the Bulldogs’ seven-game winning streak. After Hamson’s final block, which came with four seconds left and led to a shot-clock violation, Paisley Johnson was fouled setting a screen on the inbound play and made both free throws. Zykerea Rice led Gonzaga (23-3, 12-2) with 20 points.The Cal women’s basketball team is in free fall. Once considered a possible Elite 8 team and probable NCAA Tournament host site, the Bears are now on the cusp of missing the tournament altogether. Nobody feels that more intimately and can speak about it in a more informed fashion than Lindsay Gottlieb. “I think there’s a little bit of unluckiness with having lost several of the one- to three-possession games, but at this point, that’s who you are. I’m not sugarcoating it in any way,” the Bears’ head coach said. “Big picture, I’m like: ‘How the eff are we here?’ But little by little, it’s obvious. ... “No one is more disappointed in the results than I am, but what are your options? Your only option is to say: ‘Let’s get it together from here. We have the capability. This is our story. Let’s do something special.’” Cal — once 9-0 and No. 1 in the RPI — has lost five straight games, its longest skid  in three years. But back in January 2016, would-be all-time leading scorer Kristine Anigwe and eventual most prolific 3-point shooter Asha Thomas barely knew how to find their classrooms. Who:  No. 17 Arizona State (18-6, 9-4) at Cal (14-11, 5-9) When:  7 p.m. Where:  Haas Pavilion TV:  P12BA Now seniors, Anigwe and Thomas — along with grad-transfer guard Recee Caldwell — were supposed to lead Cal back to the glory of the 2013 Final Four team. Maybe they still will, but Berkeley isn’t looking so beautiful right now. The Bears (14-11, 5-9 Pac-12) play No. 17 Arizona State on Friday and Arizona in the season’s home finale Sunday — two opportunities to boost a No. 47 RPI before closing the regular season at the Washington schools. “Thank goodness, our fate is in our control,” Gottlieb said. “A Pac-12 championship isn’t in our control. An NCAA home seed isn’t in our control. But, being in the tournament, finishing strong and giving ourselves a chance, all of that’s in our control. “But, there are no more learning lessons. There’s no more figuring it out. This is do-or-die time, relative to basketball.” Cal’s skid has included losses to three top-10 teams, three during which it has trailed by three points or fewer in the final 90 seconds and two during which it led in the fourth quarter. In its most recent losses — a Los Angeles sweep last weekend — Cal had distinctly different problems. Against USC, the Bears didn’t play very hard, were awful in transition and took bad shots in the clutch. Two days later at UCLA, they committed 16 turnovers and handed out offensive rebounds (14) for free. “There’s still a lot to play for,” Gottlieb said. “None of this makes me think any differently about this team or these seniors. It only makes me more compelled to say: ‘There is only one option at this point. We have to fight our way to the highest level of our capabilities.’ “We’re going to finish differently. I believe that.”Should Warriors fans be worried this weekend, when Klay Thompson heads to Charlotte, N.C., for the NBA All-Star Game? Because you can bet the wooing, the recruiting, the stealth tampering will be happening for real. Oh, you think it was just a coincidence that LeBron James picked all free agents for his All-Star team, like he claimed? That he went after Kevin Durant and Thompson, in addition to Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving — all players he’d love to bring to the Lakers for his personal team makeover? Sure, and if you believe that was mere coincidence, you probably also believe Luke Walton’s job as the Lakers’ head coach is perfectly safe. Thompson’s looming free agency has taken a back seat in all the drama and angst and media-scolding of  Durant’s pending free agency. Thompson, in his unique way, is just tripping along through the journey, keeping total perspective, a half-smile on his face and a four-legged friend near his side. He told ESPN’s crew, before Wednesday’s game and fully unsolicited, that he wants to finish his career with the Warriors, according to broadcaster Dave Pasch. Still, expect James to recruit him hard this weekend, turning on the full persuasive power of LeBron. To slip in messages about the Lakers’ legacy that runs in Thompson’s blood. To muse about returning his father’s team back to championship status. To remind Thompson about the joys of hanging on the beach in Southern California. Sure, Durant is the big prize, but plenty of Lakers fans eye Thompson as the better choice. The perfect fit with James, because of Thompson’s defense, his quick release, his ability to move around the court and create space. He’s arguably the best two-way guard in the league, the best shooting guard in the league and one of the easiest teammates in the world. No drama. No angst. No scolding. There’s a reason that Lakers fans loudly chanted, “We want Thompson” at Oracle Arena during the Lakers’ most recent trip to the Bay Area. They really, really do. “They should want him,” Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said. “I’d chant the same thing.” Who wouldn’t want Thompson? He’s just that perfect dude. The man whose dislocated finger bends sideways yet he tapes it up, comes back, scores 22 points and is available the next night, too. “His availability every single night is one of his best attributes as an NBA player,” Kerr said after Tuesday’s win over Utah, when images of Thompson’s twisted finger caused queasiness. “Even on nights where he gets banged up, he seems to shake it off and come right back.” Thompson is extremely chill almost all the time, which is why it was unusual to see him getting into it with Zach Collins on Wednesday night in Portland. After Collins flopped on a Thompson elbow to draw an offensive foul, he started dropping F-bombs  on Thompson. Thompson went right back at him, to the delight of his teammates, who rarely see No. 11 get agitated. “I enjoyed that,” forward Draymond Green said. “He was talking bad to that dude. That was good to see.” Thompson can be fiery when needed, relaxed most of the rest of the time. He’s the man who talks to his hand when he bursts out of  a shooting slump, who dances unselfconsciously on a trip to China, who seems to operate in a rare egoless corner of the NBA. Durant flipped out and yelled at  media members to grow up when they speculated about his pending free agency. Thompson shrugs off the same topic. “I don’t think it really affects us,” he said. “We’re all grown men. At the end of the day, whatever we decide to do, we’re all brothers and we’re not going to hold any grudges because it’s business.” So, should Warriors fans be worried? No. And not just because Thompson regularly professes his love for the Warriors, like he did to the ESPN crew  Wednesday. He seems content living and playing where he is, and seems to fully appreciate the entire experience, from the day he was drafted through the metamorphosis into this championship era. The other reason Warriors fans shouldn’t be too worried: There’s no chance in the world the Warriors open Chase Center without Thompson. He is, after Stephen Curry, their second-most-beloved player. The stealth superstar. He almost surely will receive his max-contract deal and be there when the doors to the new place open. And someday, there might be a statue of Klay and Rocco the dog outside. But, for the moment, the recruiting will be hot and heavy. Because who wouldn’t want the NBA’s coolest customer?When Colin Kaepernick makes his comeback in the NFL, what kind of player and person will his new team be getting? Yes, Kaepernick is eligible to play, and eager to get a shot. Sadly for the Kaepernick-haters who pounced on the narrative that his settlement with the league meant he signed away his football future for a big payday, that is not the case. Kaepernick’s lawyer, Mark Geragos, indicated last Saturday in a CNN interview that his client is free to play in the NFL and is open to offers. However, Geragos might have been overly optimistic when he said he expects Kaepernick to draw interest from multiple teams. The vast majority of NFL teams want nothing to do with Kaepernick. Most owners either dislike him or fear him, or both. Same with a lot of coaches. Owners and coaches will be   careful not to collude via e-mail or other traceable means. They simply won’t call. I’m guessing Kaepernick is a leper to all but three or four teams. His politics and his style of play definitely work against him. So Kaepernick’s market is definitely limited. But a lot of teams are working with very shaky backup quarterbacks, and QBs get hurt a lot. So some team might take a shot on an experienced, healthy, versatile guy. If so, if he gets a chance, what will Kaepernick’s new team be getting? First of all, Kaepernick   read a defense. He read the NFL’s defense expertly. He (and his lawyer) stared down the mighty NFL at the very heart of its power, at the corporate and legal level, and picked it apart. Ah, but what about football defenses? The critics would have us believe that Kaepernick is a drooling football doofus who can’t tell a linebacker from a limburger. Let’s all agree: Kaepernick is not Tom Brady or Drew Brees. But even if he was the slack-jawed yokel many folks claim he is, he did drool the 49ers to a Super Bowl, and he fooled one of the game’s great coaches, Jim Harbaugh, who called Kaepernick a “savant.” And Harbaugh worked with Andrew Luck. But let’s give Kaepernick a “C” on reading defenses. That means half the quarterbacks in the league are dumber. What about the rest of the package? When Kaepernick’s new teammates arrive for work, he will be there waiting for them. With the 49ers, he was always the first player to arrive for practice. Always. He will be in shape and prepared, that’s a given. But will he be a good teammate? With the 49ers, he wasn’t always. There were reports of Kaepernick putting on his headphones and sinking into his own world, far from his teammates. His silly name-rank-serial-number press conferences made him and his team look bad. But the post-protest Kaepernick was a completely different dude. He dealt with the media on an intelligent, human level. More importantly, he reached out to his teammates, explaining his protest and creating an open dialogue, accepting of those who disagreed with his beliefs. In his final season, Kaepernick’s teammates voted him the Len Eshmont Award for “inspirational and courageous play.” That doesn’t mean they all loved him, but for the most part his teammates respected and understood him. Kaepernick became a rare breed, a person who can, as they say in government, reach across the aisle. He learned that he has the power to unite a team. That will be vital when he drops into a team that will surely be divided on the protest issue. Can he avoid unnecessary controversy? Unknown. Has he outgrown the pig socks and Castro t-shirt and matured into a leader, understanding the power of his protest and his fame? Is he wiser now, or merely more cynical? We’ll see. His team will be getting a guy who likely has gained wisdom and maturity from two years out of a job, time spent on the streets, working with various charities and with young people. His new team will   be signing up for a media circus. As a 49er, Kaepernick the protester handled media sessions in a dignified and non-distracting manner. He was comfortable in the spotlight, but didn’t take over the locker room. As much as Kaepernick wants to further his cause of promoting social justice and fair treatment for minorities at the hands of police, he also wants to play football, and win. When he shows up for work, he will show up for work. Kaepernick might tear up the league with his determination and fire, and with his arm and legs, or he might fall on his face, as many predict. But he will be ready. Kaepernick’s new team will get a quarterback who is committed and passionate.

Three games later, the Irish are section champions. Credrick Reed Jr. and Kori McCoy hit clutch 3-pointers in the closing minutes and Oscar Cheng had 14 points and nine rebounds as Sacred Heart Cathedral completed its improbable CCS title run with a 50-48 win over Bellarmine at Santa Clara University on Friday night. The game was tied at halftime and after three quarters before a 3-pointer from Quinn Denker (23 points) gave Bellarmine a 45-42 lead in the final three minutes. Reed then tied it before a 3-pointer before McCoy gave the Irish (13-14) the lead for good another 3 with 1:12 to go. A fastbreak hoop by Cheng gave Sacred Heart Cathedral its biggest lead, 50-45, with 35 seconds left before Denker closed the gap to two with a three-pointer with 17.1 seconds remaining. The Irish missed two front ends of one-and-ones but they held on. Third-seeded Bellarmine (20-7), which got 11 points from Ian Elam, never got a shot to tie. Sacred Heart Cathedral was the first San Francisco school to make the final in the Open Division, which began in 2013. The Irish beat top-seeded Mitty and fourth-seeded Menlo-Atherton before Friday\\'s win. All eight teams from the Open Division advance to next week’s Northern California playoffs. Girls Mitty 72, Pinewood-Los Altos Hills 51:  In the CCS Open Division final, Haley Jones had 26 points and nine rebounds and Hunter Hernandez added 21 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Monarchs (25-2) past the Panthers (24-3) at Santa Clara Unviersity for their 28th CCS title. The two players combined for 25 of Mitty’s 29 fourth-quarter points in a game the Monarchs. Pinewood got 18 points from sophomore Courtni Thompson but no other Panthers player hit double figures — including Stanford-bound Hannah Jump (six points). MItty, which got a combined 15 points from Olivia Williams and Ashley Hiraki, held big edges in rebounds (43-29), assists (10-4) and blocks (6-1). All is not lost for the Panthers. Last year, they lost in the CCS title game to Mitty, and then turned the tables in the NorCal Open final. North Coast Section Boys De La Salle-Concord 54, James Logan-Union City 46:  In the Division 1 final, Tim Kostolansky scored eight of his 21 points in the fourth quarter as the Spartans went on an 18-2 run to erase an eight-point deficit and beat the Colts for their third North Coast Section title in four years. De La Salle (28-3) seemingly had zero momentum after James Logan turned a tie game at half into the Brahjon Thompson show. Thompson made four 3-pointers — with at least two from beyond 25 feet — on his way to a 14-point third quarter that saw Logan lead by as much as 10. The Colts (24-6) finished the quarter up 44-36. Thompson, however, picked up his fourth foul in the waning seconds of the third. That left the door open for De La Salle, and the Spartans kicked it down. De La Salle scored the first 11 points of the fourth. By the time Thompson returned to the game, the Spartans held the lead for good. Thompson finished with 28 points and four steals. His cousin Brett Thompson had 12. The Colts were attempting to win their first NCS title since 1987. “That fourth quarter was unbelievable,” Spartans coach Justin Argenal said. “Defensively we really locked in. They took some tough shots and we were able to score in transition which really gave us some confidence.” Logan got its first and only basket of the fourth quarter with 2:29 to play to cut De La Salle’s lead to 47-46. The Colts’ next two possessions would end with Thomas Gregorius steals. Jeremiah Dargan punctuated the second steal with a dunk for a 51-46 lead with 1:09 to play. Gregorius finished with 16 points. Kostolansky had 13 rebounds. The Spartans and Colts both advance to the CIF Northern Regionals and will find out their divisions and seeds on Sunday. Branson-Ross 63, Fortuna 43:  In the Division 4 championship game at College of Marin, Viktor Rajkovic scored 30 points and the top-seeded Bulls (29-2) opened the second half with a 25-2 run on the way to their third straight NCS title. Down 26-24 at halftime, Branson outscored Fortuna (29-2) 18-2 in the third quarter. Girls Carondelet-Concord 80, Heritage-Brentwood 70:  Ali Bamberger had 28 points and 14 rebounds as the top-seeded Cougars (26-4) rolled over the Patriots (26-4) in the Division 1 final at St. Mary’s College to claim their fourth straight NCS title. The game was the third straight NCS finals meeting between the two schools. Carondelet never trailed and there were just two ties, but Heritage was within six points with 40 seconds to go. Seniors Erica Miller and Emily Howie went 6-for-6 from the foul line to put the game away. “It’s such a good feeling right now,” said Bamberger, a member of all four championship teams. Carondelet advances to the Open Division of the NorCal Regionals, which begin Wednesday. The Cougars forfeited their first-round regionals game last year after announcing multiple players had violated team rules. Senior point guard Jordan Sweeney led Heritage with 19 points, three assists and three steals. Heritage will also advance to NorCal regionals in either the Open Division or Division 1. St. Patrick-St. Vincent-Vallejo 66, Del Norte 62:  In the Division 4 final at Benicia, the top-seeded Bruins (27-3) went on a 15-2 run to close the half, then held off a late rally by Del Norte (24-3) to win their second NCS title and first since 2007.

They played in the same group for two days — and  Curry  was as awestruck watching Champ swing as Champ was hanging out with a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player. Champ’s tee shots zoomed into distant, preposterous frontiers, leaving Curry still marveling more than three months later. “It doesn’t even look like he’s trying,” Curry said. “And his ball doesn’t move off its line. It’s incredible.” Champ is 23, grew up in Sacramento and enters 2019 as one of the PGA Tour’s most intriguing, dynamic young players. He threatens to push golf’s power revolution into another realm entirely. Consider the numbers: Champ’s average driving distance of 343.1 yards in 2018 led all other Web.com players by nearly 10 yards. He led the PGA Tour’s fall events in driving distance (328.2 yards) and strokes gained off the tee (1.48), a broader measure of his driver’s impact. Champ, who plans to play in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in February, also brings a compelling back story. His grandfather, Mack, introduced him to the game at Haggin Oaks, a public facility in Sacramento — decades after segregation prevented Mack, who is African American, from playing golf while growing up in Columbus, Texas, outside Houston. Mack Champ joined the Air Force and picked up the game while stationed in England and Germany in the 1960s. (He hit shots at the practice range on base.) All these years later, at 77, Mack satisfies his passion for golf through his grandson’s rise to prominence. “I want to give him a chance to go to a few places he never had a chance to go,” Cameron Champ said. “That’s in the back of my mind, pushing me to get better — to play in the Masters and the other majors.” Champ inherited quiet confidence from his mom, Lisa, and athletic genes from his dad, Jeff, a former minor-league baseball player. But Mack helped steer Cameron toward golf, buying him plastic clubs when he was 18 months old and making sure they had fun playing games in the backyard. Before long, it became clear Cameron also had uncommon talent. He won a small tournament in San Francisco at age 5, then a bigger event at 8 — he shot 81 at Plumas Lake in Olivehurst (Yuba County) to beat several 12-and-older kids. All the while, Cameron played casual rounds at Haggin Oaks, where Mack worked as a marshal, and later at Whitney Oaks and North Ridge Country Club (after he landed an honorary membership). As the clock winds down on 2018, The Chronicle profiles 10 influencers who will shape the Bay Area sports landscape in 2019. A look at PGA Tour driving distance leaders over recent decades: Year Leader Avg. 2019 Cameron Champ 328.2* 2018 Rory McIlroy 319.7 2010 Robert Garrigus 315.5 2000 John Daly 301.4 1990 Tom Purtzer 279.6 1980 Dan Pohl 274.3 * Through 20 rounds Source: PGAtour.com Champ’s parents were hardly affluent, but they committed to helping him play in junior tournaments as he grew older and dedicated himself to the game. “I felt like I always had a place to play, which was obviously the key,”  Champ said. “I learned the love of the game from Grandpa.” Champ hit his growth spurt early, and by age 11 or 12 he was smacking tee shots 300 yards. He’s not especially big now — 6 feet tall and no more than 180 pounds — but he has broad shoulders, a thick chest and strong legs. That helps explain his power, as does his off-the-charts swing speed and ball speed. It’s no surprise to Mike Woods, longtime director of golf at Haggin Oaks. Woods recalled seeing young Cameron traipsing around the course with Mack, carefree and clearly skilled beyond his years. “He always reminds me of the athlete who could pack it up to 230 or 240 pounds and play linebacker,” Woods said. “He’s a strong, athletic kid, but he was that way at age 14.” Woods remembered one time, when Champ was 16 or 17 and joined him in a long-drive exhibition at a charity event at Granite Bay. Woods hit his shot about 270 yards and Tom Morton, another club pro, hit his maybe 280. Then Champ uncorked his effortless, efficient swing and hit one that, in his mind, was nothing special. They used a laser to measure the shots — and Champ’s drive had traveled 85 yards past Morton’s. Champ unveiled this eye-popping power to a wider audience in June 2017, when he qualified for the U.S. Open as an amateur (after his college career at Texas A&M) and bashed his way into early contention. He ultimately tied for 32nd. His low, searing tee shots, routinely carrying 340 yards, wowed Rory McIlroy during a practice round that week at Erin Hills. Not much changed after Champ turned pro; he smacked one 430 yards, with an assist from the altitude and a friendly cart-path bounce, during his Web.com victory in Utah in July. “It’s just crazy the way he can hit the ball and hit it straight,” Mack Champ said. “That’s the key. A lot of guys past and present were big hitters, but they didn’t know where it was going. Cam has a lot of control of his driver. If he hits it well, he’ll be in the running at any tournament.” Champ validated his grandfather’s confidence this fall, when he finished in the top 30 in his first five starts as a PGA Tour member. That included three top-10s and his inaugural victory Oct. 28 at the Sanderson Farms Championship in Mississippi. He was ranked No. 1,057 in the world at the end of 2017. Now he’s No. 95. “I feel like I belong out there and I feel like I can win,” Champ said. “I’m just playing free, and that’s when I play my best golf. That’s a good feeling.”Frankie Ferrari had a career-high 23 points and USF overcame a 14-point deficit in the second half to knock off BYU 77-71 in Provo, Utah, on Thursday night. The Dons (21-6, 9-4) were down 63-49 with 7½ minutes left before going on a 10-0 run that was capped by Charles Minlend’s drive with a little more than four minutes remaining. The game was tied 68-68 with 1½ minutes to go before Jordan Ratinho put the Dons ahead to stay with a 3-pointer. The victory gives USF a season sweep over BYU (18-11, 10-4). That could be key in determining which team gets the No. 2 seed in the WCC tournament. The top two teams don’t play until the semifinals. Ferrari had a superb all-around game, as he went 9-for-12 from the floor, including 5-for-5 from beyond the arc. He added seven assists and six rebounds. Yoeli Childs had 28 points and 14 rebounds for the Cougars, who had won their previous five games. TJ Haws added 25 points. St. Mary’s 58, Pacific 32:  In Stockton, Jordan Ford nearly outscored the Tigers (13-15, 3-10) as the Gaels (18-10, 9-4) remained tied for third in the conference with USF. The Gaels’ guard, who entered Thursday leading the WCC in scoring at 21.6 points per game, finished with 28. No other player on either team scored more than eight points. The Tigers went 10-for-48 (20.8 percent) from the floor, including 2-for-11 (18.2 percent) from long range. Women #15 Gonzaga 74, Santa Clara 61:  At the Leavey Center, Zykera Rice had 15 points and nine rebounds to lead the Zags (24-3, 13-2) over the Broncos (11-15, 4-11). LMU 69, St. Mary’s 56:  In Los Angeles, Chelsey Gipson scored 25 points as the Lions (16-11, 9-6) handled the Gaels (18-9, 11-5). Portland 69, USF 66:  On the Hilltop, Shannon Powell hit a tying bucket for the Dons (6-20, 2-13) with 2:20 left in the game, but Haylee Andrews hit a jumper on the ensuing possession that put the Pilots (12-14, 4-11) ahead to stay. Chronicle staff writer  Steve Kroner contributed  to this report.Even if their pitching plans weren’t  wildly up in the air , the A’s would feature prominent prospect Jesus Luzardo front and center at some point this season. As it is, the 21-year-old — who has only worked in four games at the Triple-A level — might well be on the front end of Oakland’s rotation to start the season. Scouts who have seen him believe Luzardo will be in the running for the league’s Rookie of the Year award. “He’s the real deal,” one National League scout said. “Zero doubt about it.” Luzardo draws heady comparisons. Even during his amateur days, observers said he reminded them of former Twins left-handers Johan Santana, a two-time Cy Young winner, and Francisco Liriano. Around the A’s organization, Luzardo is spoken of in terms reserved only for the team’s top starters over the past 20 years: All-Stars Tim Hudson, Barry Zito (the 2002 Cy Young winner) and Mark Mulder. “We haven’t had a pitcher like him since the Big Three,” A’s special assistant Grady Fuson said. “He’s one of the best things to come along here in a while. If you take our own history, he has better stuff than Mulder. He’s got better heat than Zito. You could kind of compare him to Gio Gonzalez at the same point, but with much, much better command. “I don’t see any way he can’t break with us. Without a doubt. No-brainer.” Some team officials even pushed for Luzardo, then 20, to pitch out of the A’s bullpen in September, but he was on a strict innings count for the season while returning from his 2016 Tommy John surgery. He was shut down at Triple-A Nashville in late August to stick to that careful rehab plan. He went 10-5 with a 2.88 ERA at three levels last season, and will operate with no innings restrictions in 2019. Still, one scout who called Luzardo “top-of-the-rotation caliber” said this week that he believes Luzardo would benefit from more minor-league time, despite Oakland’s pressing need for starters. “Man, I wouldn’t push him, even though mentally he seems strong,” said the American League scout, who saw Luzardo twice last season. “More than anything, I think he just needs time to adapt to higher-level hitters and learn how to adjust from at-bat to at-bat and game to game. I think more Double-A and Triple-A time would serve him well.” An NL scout agreed, saying, “I think midseason makes more sense — but there’s no question Luzardo can handle it. He’s so polished. He has a plan. He’s really impressive.” The best bet is that Luzardo will be on the roster by late March when the team returns from playing its first two regular-season games in Tokyo, and he might be considered to start one of the exhibition games in Japan and one in the Bay Bridge series. The A’s would like to get him all the experience they can pitching in different atmospheres and in front of big crowds. Of course, Luzardo already has done so: He started the Futures Game for the World team during All-Star week in Washington last summer. He fits the “world” description pretty well. He was born to Venezuelan parents in Peru — Luzardo will become the first Peru-born player in the majors when he is promoted — and he moved to South Florida when he was 1. He grew up following Venezuelan pitchers such as Santana and future AL West foe Felix Hernandez. Luzardo attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., graduating in 2016, but he still works out there during the winter, and last year, like many of his friends and members of the community,  he had to cope with a tragedy.  A former student opened fire on students and teachers, killing 17 of them, including Luzardo’s friend, athletic director Chris Hixon. Luzardo, who had planned to be at the baseball field that day, set up a fund to benefit Hixon’s wife and two sons and raised $10,000 in four months. “We knew that school shooting had affected him, and what he did for his community was really impressive,” said outfielder J.P. Sportman, a teammate of Luzardo at Double-A Midland and Triple-A Nashville. “He’s very caring,” A’s assistant director of player development Ed Sprague said. “The thing that happened last offseason shook him up but he handled it well. People he loved got hurt, one of them was killed, and he handled it with class.” As the clock winds down on 2018, The Chronicle profiles 10 influencers who will shape the Bay Area sports landscape in 2019. Age:  21  Bats/Throws:  L/L Height, weight:  6-1, 205 Minor-league stats Year Levels W-L ERA 2017 Rookie, A 2-1 1.66 2018 A, AA, AAA 10-5 2.88 Total 12-6 2.53 Luzardo’s maturity is among many reasons evaluators believe he’ll be in the big leagues soon. But it’s the talent, first and foremost, that makes even the game’s top hitters do a double-take. Luzardo was borrowed to start a spring training game against the Angels last spring, worked 22/3 innings and struck out three — including two-time MVP Mike Trout. “I always watch hitters’ reactions, and Trout walked off with a quizzical look on his face like, ‘Oh, that was some   s—,’ ” an NL scout said. “I immediately called my club and said, ‘I just saw a really special young left-hander.’ ” Along with throwing a fastball in the mid- to upper-90s, Luzardo has a nasty change-up — “a plus-plus pitch,” one scout said — and a good curveball. And his delivery is simple and smooth; he repeats it without difficulty. “Jesus is unique,” said Billy Owens, A’s assistant general manager and director of player personnel. “He’s got high artillery — fastball up to 97 mph, a plus breaking ball, a swing-and-miss changeup. His stuff is upper-echelon, elite, off the charts. And as good as his stuff is, his poise and presence are even better. He gets your attention right away, he exceeds all the hyperbole and he’s never disappointed.” According to Sportman, Luzardo also adjusted well on the rare occasions he ran into trouble. “Jesus was definitely so far ahead of everyone else. I never saw him crumble,” Sportman said. “Even when things weren’t going well, he was always able to bounce back — and I didn’t see many times where he had any trouble. Even against the more advanced hitters at Triple-A, guys who’d been to the big leagues, he was still able to control the game, and he was fun to play behind, too. That makes the game a lot easier.” The A’s acquired Luzardo in the Sean Doolittle-Ryan Madson deal with Washington in 2017, a deal that also brought over closer Blake Treinen and minor-league infielder Sheldon Neuse. “The A’s struck gold in that deal,” Sportman said. “I was telling people with the stuff Jesus was doing toward the end of last year, he should be in the big leagues; no one could touch him.” During the winter meetings this month, manager Bob Melvin and general manager David Forst discussed Luzardo as a  rotation candidate this spring. The time is coming, and soon. “Everything about this kid is to love,” said Fuson. “He’s 21 years old, but it’s hard not to sit here and gush,” Owens said. “He’s as good a prospect as we’ve had in the last 20 years. I know Jesus Luzardo will be a fixture in the major-league rotation for a long time.”In the world of college football “revenue games,” the San Jose State Spartans are prolific. They’ve been playing much better competition for money, a practice both criticized and applauded in collegiate circles, since the 1950s. In the process, they’ve made millions of dollars to support the school’s athletic program. In many ways, the Spartans are a case study in the pay-for-play arena of big-time college football. The school fields a competitive team, but it’s almost always overmatched against the  powerhouse programs scheduled every year. But the athletic department coffers benefit. Is San Jose State just playing the role of the perennial piñata, sacrificing its young players for financial gain? Or has the school mastered the system, leveraging scheduling problems for profit? If you ask people at San Jose State, they’ll tell you it all works for the Spartans. Consider the case of former San Jose State receiver Chandler Jones, who was thrown into a high-pressure situation in the very first game of his college  career. The Spartans had scheduled the nation’s top-ranked team, Alabama, to start the 2010 season. When Jones first got into the huddle, he couldn’t hear a word the quarterback was saying because the crowd of 101,821 at Bryant-Denny Stadium was so loud. “We used hand signals and went up-tempo, with no huddle,” he said. He recalls the game fondly, despite taking a 48-3 beating. “You get a chance to put your best foot forward against those teams, and you might get noticed off of it,” said Jones, the Spartans’ all-time leader in receptions (248) and touchdown catches (29) who  had brief stints with three NFL teams and played in Canada. “There’s no down side. You get to play football. It’s another opportunity to get better and put up a win.” That day in Alabama, San Jose State  was paid $900,000. That game was part of a very profitable run for the Spartans, who have played as many revenue games as any school in the country. The result is almost always a beatdown on the field. Since 2010, the Spartans are 0-13 in revenue games and have been outscored 516-155. But the practice also has brought millions into the university’s athletic program. Over the course of those 13 games, the Spartans have pocketed $9.4 million. They’ll make another $1 million  Saturday at Oregon. The athletic department says it couldn’t function at its current level without the games. “Student fees are maxed out,” San Jose State athletic director Marie Tuite said. “I don’t think the school would choose not to play in a ‘money game’ if the consequence was to drop sports. Dropping sports is a really tough decision. Whenever I read about it (at another school), I feel a sense of angst for the president, the athletic director, the coaches and the athletes who are involved.” Last season the Spartans were paid $1 million to fly to Austin, where they were summarily pounded 56-0 by Texas. “Nobody wants to do that,” Tuite said. “You want to be competitive in the game. Most times, you hope to be competitive through halftime, and then in the second half, you never know what’s going to happen. Where you get challenged is in the depth factor. We don’t have the same depth as Texas has.” Sometimes, San Jose State is on the paying end. It gave UC Davis $400,000 to pay a Week 1 visit this year; the Aggies not only got the money but beat the Spartans 44-38. A lucrative future Looking ahead, San Jose State will play at Arkansas (2019), Penn State (2020) and Georgia (2021). The going rate for those games is at least $1.5 million, and the Georgia game will bring SJSU a school-record $1.8 million. The cost of flying a team, coaches, staff, school officials and equipment across the country and paying for hotels and meals can eat up as much as $100,000 from the payout. But even after taking that into consideration, there’s plenty left over. San Jose State has a $26.5 million annual athletics budget, with which it fields 22 varsity teams, 13 of them for women. A school needs to have 16 overall teams to stay in Division I of the NCAA. Nearly 6 percent of this year’s budget — $1.525 million — will come from the school’s two big revenue games (Oregon $1 million; Washington State $525,000). “Eight or nine years ago, you couldn’t get ‘money games’ for $1.6 or $1.8 million,” Tuite said. “Because the revenues have increased so much at the Power-5 (major conference) level, it’s created this opportunity where a school like San Jose State can get $1.8 from Georgia in 2021.” The series Every year, you see mismatches on college schedules.

Second-year head coach Brent Brennan knows his team faces long odds in revenue games, but he accepts them as part of the job. He discounts the suggestion that they lead to more injuries than other games and says there are on-field benefits for his team. “I think you get beat up playing football,” he said. “We got beat up just as much playing Cal Poly last year as we did playing Texas or Utah. Football’s a physical game. Sometimes there’s a certain amount of good fortune in staying healthy. “It’s an advantage in that we get tested by a really good team early. It gives us a chance to see where we’re at early in the season. Can we make a run into the conference discussion based on how we compare against some of these revenue teams?” A showcase for players The players say they enjoy getting a chance to play against teams studded with NFL prospects. Tight end Josh Oliver, a pro prospect, said that for players like him, “It’s kind of a statement game. You weren’t recruited by those Power-5  teams. It’s a chance to show yourself to the other teams.” Senior defensive lineman Bryson Bridges said that when the Spartans played at Texas last year, “it was an awesome experience. Going into a stadium with 90,000-100,000 people, it gives you a different rush.” Tuite also sees beyond-the-payday upsides. “Our student-athletes really love playing the Auburns, the Alabamas, the Texases because of the big stage,”  she said. “Our fans like to go to those arenas. It creates an excitement around your football program.” San Jose State’s greatest success playing a big-conference opponent has come against Stanford, which it has beaten four times in 14 meetings in the past two decades, mostly when the Cardinal were struggling. The Spartans haven’t beaten a Power-5 team on the road since topping Stanford in 2000. Tuite said ideally she would like to book a weaker team from the best conferences, take a big check and hope to strike lightning on the field. That strategy, unfortunately, involves taking guesses about the future. Tuite pointed out that in 2012, when San Jose State scheduled a 2014 game at Auburn, the Tigers were winless in the SEC. When the game arrived, Auburn was No. 5 in the country and steamrolled the Spartans 59-13. “Thanks for scheduling this one,” then-head coach Ron Caragher wryly told Tuite afterward.Former Warriors swingman Stephen Jackson is pleased players have more of a say in where they play, but he questions how much this generation loves the game. \"I love the fact that players have control of where they want to play,\" Jackson said before Golden State’s 125-123 win over Sacramento on Thursday night at Oracle Arena. \"But at the same time, guys got to be professional, too. I would be the first to say these guys these days, they\\'re spoiled. A lot of them are spoiled. \"And I was talking to a Hall of Fame football coach and he said one thing he sees about basketball from the outside looking in, more players today are interested in what the game can do for them. They don\\'t actually love the game like we did. I\\'m 41 years old, and I still play the game every day.\" Jackson’s comments came in response to a question about player empowerment in the NBA, which has become a hot topic in the wake of news that New Orleans big man Anthony Davis is requesting a trade. Jackson, ex-Golden State guard Jason Richardson and former Warriors head coach Don Nelson were on hand at Oracle Arena as part of a celebration of the 2006-07 \"We Believe\" team. Nelson, who last coached in 2010, was happy that players these days have more control over their career trajectories than they did when he played in the 1960s and ’70s. \"You couldn\\'t leave a team,\" Nelson said. \"You were there for life. As long as they wanted to put you on the roster, you had nothing to do with a lot of things that are important to players today, which is movement, money, salaries. \"So, it\\'s way better now than it used to be because I was in those locker rooms in the old days when you couldn\\'t — once you were with a team, you couldn\\'t leave.\"Her journey took some twists and turns, but Abby Dahlkemper has moved from the pristine little soccer field at Atherton’s Sacred Heart to the spine of the U.S. women’s national team. If, as expected, she makes the final roster for the team that will travel to the Women’s World Cup in France in June, Dahlkemper will play a major role in the Americans’ attempt to defend their world championship. Defense is critical: A largely remade back line and a relatively untested goalkeeper will face the best strikers in the women’s game. Dahlkemper, 25, has become a mainstay at center back and will be a defensive anchor. “Everyone’s journey is different,” Dahlkemper said, sitting at the Sacred Heart field, just a few minutes from where she grew up in Menlo Park. “Mine just took a little bit longer. Everyone has their own path.” After playing for Sacred Heart and the Mountain View Los Altos soccer club, Dahlkemper was recruited to UCLA by current national-team coach Jill Ellis. Though Ellis was gone by the time Dahlkemper landed in Westwood, the original contact proved fruitful. Unlike some of the other fresh faces who were tapped for the national team while in college or even earlier, Dahlkemper played four years in college without getting a call-up. She developed her skills on U.S. Soccer youth teams, was drafted by the National Women’s Soccer League and even played in Adelaide, Australia, for a short time. In the NWSL, Dahlkemper helped the North Carolina Courage to three consecutive finals and two titles. In 2017, she was named the league’s Defender of the Year. “I’m so thankful for the league because it gives so many players opportunities to keep playing,” she said. “The experiences that I had helped me continue to develop. I was ready to go in when I did.” When Ellis was remaking the national-team roster after the 2016 Olympics and the ensuing end-of-cycle personnel changes, she called on Dahlkemper. “She’s got tremendous poise,” Ellis said last year. “Her distribution, her quality of delivery. I think she’s a natural playmaker in the back. “She has a ruggedness about her, a physical dimension to her. I think you have to be brave to be in the back, and she’s brave.” Dahlkemper had to be really brave two years ago. She finally got her chance, making her first national-team appearance in October 2016. But a few weeks later, Dahlkemper injured her toe and contracted a serious sepsis infection, which traveled up her leg. The injury developed when the team was training at Avaya Stadium. Dahlkemper’s mother came down to San Jose to check on her and ended up driving her to the hospital. Suddenly, everything was in doubt. As the clock winds down on 2018, The Chronicle profiles 10 influencers who will shape the Bay Area sports landscape in 2019. “Anytime there’s an injury, you wonder, ‘Am I going to be the same player?’ or ‘Was that it?’” Dahlkemper said. “But this injury was different. I was just thankful to still have my leg. To be alive, and all that. It was a really humbling experience.” Dahlkemper underwent surgery to clean out the infection. She was bed-ridden for 1½ months and on intravenous antibiotics. When she finally was able to move around, her dominant right foot was in constant pain and her right leg was severely atrophied. “I was starting from scratch,” she said. Yet she fought back. She started the NWSL season in April and Ellis called her back to the national team in June 2017. That summer, she started being paired with Becky Sauerbrunn, one of the only back-line holdovers from 2015. “I learn so much from her,” Dahlkemper said. “I’m eager to learn. It helps playing alongside one of the best defenders in the world, if not the very best.” In the past two years, despite the frightening injury, Dahlkemper has played every minute of every NWSL game and has earned 30 caps with the national team. “Looking at my development, it’s night and day since I was called in,” she said. “My confidence, my mentality, my decision-making.” America’s rugged, brave defender cuddles her 9-week-old Cockapoo puppy, Bobbi Brown, as she speaks. While Bobbi is growing into a dog, her caretaker will be playing a grueling 10-game World Cup preparation schedule. The team will hold a camp in Portugal and then play twice in Europe before embarking on eight stateside games, including one against South Africa at Levi’s Stadium on May 12. “It’s going to test us as a team,” she said. “It’s go-time right now for everyone.” Including Dahlkemper. A new backbone of  America’s greatest soccer team.Calgary’s Austin Czarnik and Johnny Gaudreau scored 29 seconds apart in the third period to lead the host Flames to a 4-2 win over the New York Islanders on Wednesday. Mikael Backlund and Travis Hamonic also scored as Calgary won its third straight after a four-game skid to take a three-point lead over the Sharks for the top spot in the Pacific Division and Western Conference. Casey Cizikas and Anders Lee scored for the Metropolitan Division-leading Islanders, whose loss was their third in regulation in their past 16 games. Lee tied it 1:18 into the third when he one-timed a pass from Jordan Eberle into the net. Who:  Sharks (35-17-8) at Pittsburgh (32-21-7) When:  4 p.m. TV/Radio:  NBCSCA/98.5 Notable:  The Sharks claimed former San Jose center Micheal Haley off waivers from Florida. Czarnik then put the Flames back ahead at 6:10 and eight seconds after New York’s Nick Leddy was whistled for interference, Gaudreau made it 4-2 with his 30th goal. Bruins 3, Golden Knights 2:  David Backes scored the decisive goal in the sixth round of the shootout as visiting Boston extended its winning streak to seven games. Vegas has lost five of its past six overall and is 1-6 in its past seven home games. Avalanche 7, Jets 1:  Nathan MacKinnon and Matt Calvert scored 11 seconds apart as part of Colorado’s five-goal third period and Semyon Varlamov made 26 saves as the host Avalanche won a second game in a row for the first time since late November. In addition, MacKinnon’s power-play goal snapped Colorado’s 0-for-29 dry spell on the man advantage. Blackhawks 5, Red Wings 4:  Patrick Kane scored two goals, including the winner 2:42 into overtime, for visiting Chicago. Dylan Larkin and Andreas Athanasiou scored two goals each for Detroit, which rallied from a 4-1 third-period deficit to tie it. Briefly:  Minnesota traded forward Charlie Coyle (10 goals, 18 assists this season) to Boston for forward Ryan Donato (three goals, six assists) and a draft pick. ... Anaheim wing Jakob Silfverberg (five years), Arizona defenseman Jordan Oesterle (two years) and Dallas defenseman Joel Hanley (two years) agreed to contract extensions. ... Philadelphia defenseman Radko Gudas was suspended for two games for high-sticking Tampa Bay forward Nikita Kucherov on Tuesday. ... Buffalo wing Kyle Okposo will be out indefinitely because of a concussion, his third in less than three years.SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — In every city, reporters and camera crews would approach Dereck Rodriguez. He was pleasant to a fault, but you could see the wariness in his eyes because he knew which way the inquisition would turn. A young man who has spent a lifetime trying to forge his own identity could not get through an interview without a question that included the words “your dad.” It’s amazing how a surprising breakout season in the majors can shift the conversation. “The ‘my dad’ questions are fading a little bit,” Rodriguez said before a recent workout at Scottsdale Stadium. “People are asking me more about my offseason and year.” On May 29, “Ivan Rodriguez’s son” made his major-league debut. Now, after endearing himself to Giants fans with a season that generated Rookie of the Year conversations, “Dereck Rodriguez” wants to take the next step toward becoming a top-end pitcher, starting more games, becoming one of those 200-inning men he so admires. Question is, will the Giants let him? As a rookie, Rodriguez threw 168 ⅔ innings in the majors and minors combined while  pitching for an old-school manager  in a more traditional organization. Bruce Bochy remains his manager, but the new top executive, Farhan Zaidi, skews more toward a philosophy that babies younger pitchers. Ask Ross Stripling, whom the Dodgers pulled in the eighth inning while he was throwing a no-hitter in San Francisco, or Brock Stewart or Walker Buehler or Julio Urias — all of whom endured some combination of having starts skipped or shortened, being sent to the bullpen, or finding themselves back in Triple-A Oklahoma City for no cause beyond protecting their arms. Maybe the media did extrapolate too much from Zaidi’s suggestion during the winter meetings that he might use openers, which caused a stir that he now says was overblown. But he also has stood by his preference for a large stable of starting pitchers, not just as protection in case some get hurt, but to provide management the choice of demoting those with options so their starts and innings can be structured and controlled in the minors, particularly early in the season as they build arm strength. “I saw the comments. I didn’t let it bother me,” Rodriguez said. “I’m going to come in here and change their mind, change their opinion and his mind-set about all that.” Rodriguez is not all that young at 26, but in pitching years, he is. He has thrown just 590 innings since his conversion from the outfield in 2014. Andrew Suarez, also 26, might find himself in the same boat after pitching 183 ⅔ innings in 2018. Still, the Giants might prove more cautious with starter Shaun Anderson, who, at 24, is expected to make his big-league debut at some point in 2019, and Logan Webb, who is 22 and might have a shot later in the season. It’s not hard to imagine a season-opening rotation of Madison Bumgarner, Derek Holland, Jeff Samardzija, Drew Pomeranz and Chris Stratton (who is out of minor-league options), with Rodriguez and Suarez at Triple-A or in the bullpen. Though the rules say Zaidi must pick a 25-man roster for Opening Day, he hardly views that as a finish line. He proved in Los Angeles he is not shy about using the transaction wire. A pitcher who starts the year in Sacramento might not be there for long, and once promoted, said pitcher also might find himself back in Sacramento  Giants bullpen coach Matt Herges is familiar with how this works. He was the Dodgers’ Triple-A pitching coach in 2016 and ’17. Herges had to play consoling father and psychologist to young Dodgers who threw in the big leagues and were sent down not just for lousy performance, but as part of more global roster machinations. Herges understands the philosophy, and he stands behind it. “These guys are young enough to where we are still stewards of their health,” he said. “We’re in charge of them staying healthy, because they’re very talented. We want them to be San Francisco Giants for a long time. “Last year, I thought Suarez’s and Rodriguez’s workload got to the point of, OK, let’s get through this healthy and give them a full offseason. You’re always thinking about their health.” Rodriguez is still his father’s son, inheriting the bullheadedness gene, and would have a hard time accepting any scheme that has him pitching less in 2019, not more. “My goal is to throw as many innings as possible,” he said. “I love going out there for more than five, six, seven innings and giving my team a chance to win. I’m one of those old-school pitchers, like Shark back in the day, throwing 200 innings for multiple years. That’s my goal, at least.” For the next year, anyway, Rodriguez will have an ally in the manager’s office. “Bochy ain’t afraid to leave me out there, and I ain’t afraid of the challenge,” Rodriguez said. “I feel as the game goes on, the pressure, that’s when the best part of me comes out.”SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — On a team rife with question marks, hopes and expectations, Steven Duggar delivers on all three fronts. The Giants’ young center fielder burst onto the scene with a major-league glove in July, thrilling the crowds at Third and King with his circus act. He struggled a bit at the plate, but showed signs of figuring things out in August, even moving into the lead-off spot for a handful of games. It sure looked like the Giants had found a building block. Then came Aug. 28, and an unfortunate baserunning incident that injured Duggar’s shoulder and ended his promising season. Cue the question marks, hopes and expectations. Can Duggar come back from surgery on a torn labrum? The Giants sure hope so. And if he bounces back, you can expect to see Duggar at the top of Bruce Bochy’s lineup card. That’s a lot to unpack. But Duggar, and the Giants, are hard at it. “I’m out there throwing. Running around. The rest of the body is coming around,” Duggar told The Chronicle. “I’m excited. ... I want to pick up where I left off. I felt like I was getting to a good spot.” Bochy and his staff are proceeding with caution. They’ve marked March 1 on the calendar for Duggar’s return to live action. “He’s pretty close,” said Giants bench coach Hensley Meulens. “He’s been doing everything on the field. Hitting, running, defensive stuff. ... First and foremost, we want him to be healthy.” Bochy put it this way: “He’s coming along fine. ... We just don’t want him diving for a ball.” Yet. Once he’s cleared for takeoff, you’ll be seeing plenty of Duggar in flight. That’s just the way he plays the game. Meulens, who works with the Giants’ outfielders, thinks his 25-year-old student can be special. He says many of his peers compare Duggar with longtime defensive standout Steve Finley. That guy won five Gold Gloves. Duggar’s “an elite athlete that can go get the ball,” Meulens said. “He can throw. Hopefully, he can put it all together and sustain it. That’s what good players do. They have longevity, and hopefully he can be that for us for a long time.” That’s two hopefullys, for those scoring at home. Mr. Duggar is also hopefully hoping. But I wouldn’t say he sounds worried. “I think the preparation part of it, asking questions, and applying it to the game ... those things were coming to fruition for me, before I got hurt,” Duggar said. “I felt like I had established a good bit of confidence along the way.” It didn’t hurt to have some big names to learn from. You can start with outfielder Andrew McCutchen, a teammate last year who helped bring the young man along. Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford isn’t too bad with the glove, either. “There was a whole bunch of guys,” said Duggar. “I would ask Cutch questions. Guy’s played that position at an elite level for a long time. “I’d talk to Craw. Defensively, that’s kind of who I want to be: a guy who has a couple gold gloves.” Duggar was earning his graduate degree in baseball, from a roomful of professors. “Just being able to bounce questions off those guys ... Honestly, I could go down the line,” Duggar said. “Buster (Posey). Pablo (Sandoval), same way. HP (Hunter Pence), same way. They care about you. They care about the team.” The team in question will look a lot different if Duggar can pull it all together and solidify his spot as an everyday Giant.  The front office is hedging its bets, picking up two right-handed-hitting outfielders — Drew Ferguson and Cameron Maybin —  who can man center field. In terms of Duggar’s bat, he talks about learning how to prepare in the big leagues last summer: studying pitchers; having a plan at the plate. He hit .255 in 141 at-bats,  with 11 doubles.  He went from looking tentative to being aggressive. He had a string of key hits just before getting hurt. That all plays into the hopes and expectations part of the equation. If he does struggle, Duggar could wind up in a platoon situation. He also has minor-league options left, so if Bochy and Co. don’t feel he’s quite right for Opening Day, they could start his season in the minor leagues. He’s heard all the scenarios, along with the chorus of critics who feel the Giants’ outfield is too young and inexperienced. That motivates Duggar and his teammates. “We all have a chip on our shoulders. Just because we’re not established doesn’t mean we can’t play at this level,” he said. “I know there’s going to be failure along the way, but it’s baseball. Try to stay consistent.” Hard to question that logic.When George Kittle was a blocking tight end at Iowa and an under-the-radar rookie with the 49ers, he told himself he’d never turn down an autograph request. Then Kittle had more receiving yards than any tight end in NFL history in 2018. And now those autograph requests are piling up like his statistics in his breakout season. “It’s really, really hard” to sign everything, Kittle said in a phone interview. “I’m not going to lie: It’s a difficult thing because it doesn’t run out. People keep showing up. And they keep showing up. “I have a little bit of a timer in my head, but I usually don’t notice (it’s time to go) until my wrist gets a little tired. The Pro Bowl was wild. There were just so many fans.” Life obviously has changed for Kittle, whose early offseason has made it clear the 2017 fifth-round pick has moved from relative anonymity to NFL celebrity. A year ago, before his record-breaking 1,377-yard season, Kittle was a project who had collected 1,252 combined receiving yards in his four-year college career and first NFL season. Now, that second season has led to a series of firsts. In the past three-plus weeks, Kittle has played in his first Pro Bowl, appeared in his first commercial (an online-only spot for Visa), made his first trip outside the United States (he went to Canada on behalf of NFL International) and realized a quirky dream by inking his first deal with Skittles. Kittle served as a brand ambassador for Visa and Skittles during Super Bowl week in Atlanta — meaning he signed short-term promotional contracts tied to the event. He then traveled to Toronto, where he met with fans and sponsors on Super Bowl Sunday as part of his 36-hour visit. The two-week tour — from Orlando to Atlanta to Toronto — was filled with interviews, glad-handing and, naturally, autograph requests. And it provided Kittle, a 25-year-old with an engaging personality, a glimpse into a  future that could include long-term endorsements and other off-the-field opportunities. In his tongue-in-cheek, 15-second Visa commercial, Kittle has so much extra time after using the tap-to-pay credit card that he takes up painting and produces a brilliant self-portrait. (Said Kittle of his acting chops: “I took drama in eighth grade. So I’m ready.”) As part of his work hawking candy, Kittle sported a red shirt with the company logo and enthusiastically punctuated each of his many interviews on radio row in Atlanta with his go-to line: “You can’t spell Skittles without Kittle.” “Watching George grow and come out — we’re all getting to see his personality,” said Kittle’s agent, Jack Bechta. “It’s very natural. He’s very outgoing. He’s very gregarious. He’s a guy you always just want to throw in a room and you can trust that he’s just going to be himself and have fun.” Bechta’s agency, JB Sports, arranged for its client to finally connect with Skittles, which is among a list of Kittle’s passions that include pro wrestling and Panda Express. As a junior in high school, Kittle sported custom cleats that included the phrase “Taste the Rainbow,” which is part of Skittle’s long-running advertising campaign. More recently, he’d taken to hounding the company on social media. “Well, I tweeted them pretty often: ‘What’s up? I’m wearing your T-shirt,’” Kittle said. “Like I said, I’ve been plugging it for a while.” Kittle also wants to send this message to 49ers fans: He’s not ditching hard work and going Hollywood. Last year, he was voted one of five team captains midway through his second season, which was partly a nod to his commitment and drive. He credited last year’s offseason work in Tennessee for much of his 2018 success, and he returned to Nashville after the Super Bowl to begin preparing for the 2019 season. Kittle noted he started training last year during Super Bowl week, meaning he’s a week behind. “The whole thing has just been fun,” Kittle said. “But right now, I’m happy it’s over and I can work out and do football things. That is one thing I am thankful for: It’s a two-week thing, and it’s back to the grind. And I love the grind.” Kittle’s agency had another promotional opportunity lined up, but Kittle declined it to begin his six-day-a-week program that includes speed, agility, strength and route-running work with a group of NFL players that includes 49ers quarterback C.J. Beathard. Kittle is living with Green Bay tight end Robert Tonyan until he returns to Santa Clara for the start of the 49ers’ offseason program in April. “George and his family are aware of the fact that what butters his bread is being successful on the field,” Bechta said. “He’s also grounded to the fact that he’s had one great year. And one great year doesn’t make a great player. And now the challenge for him is can he do it again with popularity, noise and opportunity being thrown at him? That’s the challenge.” Beyond proving 2018 wasn’t a fluke, Kittle, who will earn a $645,000 base salary this season, won’t lack for financial motivation: He is eligible to sign what could be a massive contract extension after the 2019 season. How much more might he earn? Kansas City’s Travis Kelce — whose 1,336 yards last year would have been the NFL record for tight ends were it not for Kittle — will make $8.75 million next season. As part of his offseason improvement plan, Kittle plans to connect with 2019 Hall of Fame inductee Tony Gonzalez, the Cal alum who is widely recognized as the best tight end in NFL history. Niners tight ends coach Jon Embree, who was Gonzalez’s position coach for three seasons with Kansas City, is coordinating a meeting between the tight ends. In the meantime, Kittle will work to stay ahead of less heralded players at his position. When asked about guarding against an overinflated ego given the attention he’s receiving, Kittle said he stays humbled by the prospect of losing his starting job. He pointed to last year’s midseason win over the Raiders, which he briefly left because of a cracked rib. In Kittle’s absence, undrafted rookie Ross Dwelley had his first NFL reception. The lesson that was reinforced for the record-breaking tight end from humble beginnings: His job is never safe. “That was awesome and I love Dwelley,” Kittle said. “But it’s like, ‘Hey, I can’t let those opportunities go away.’ And I’ve learned that. I always think about it. So that keeps me pretty grounded.”Tim Kostolansky evidently took his matchup with Keshad Johnson on Wednesday in the North Coast Section Division 1 semifinals very seriously. The 6-foot-7 senior for top-seeded De La Salle-Concord had 20 points and 15 rebounds, leading the  host Spartans (27-3) to a 60-46 win over fourth-seeded San Leandro (24-5), which got 13 points from Lawrence Long. Nobody else scored in double figures for San Leandro, including Johnson, a 6-7 forward headed to San Diego State who finished with just six points and two buckets on eight shots. Kostolansky did most of the work on Johnson, but had lots of help. The Spartans allowed just 28 points through three quarters. Thomas Gregorios added 13 points, freshman Jeremiah Dargan 11 and Andrew Flannigan 10 for the Spartans, who go for their 11th NCS title at 8 p.m. Friday against James Logan-Union City at St. Mary’s College. “It always starts at the defensive end for us,” Kostolansky said. “We focus there first and the offense always comes. Our defense and rebounding really keyed things for us.” James Logan 86, Dublin 83:  Tim Oldham raced toward Dublin’s basket to grab the ball, turned and fired in a 30-footer at the buzzer to give third-seeded Logan (24-5) a win at second-seed Dublin (25-5). The Colts trailed 68-58 in the fourth quarter, then seemingly had the game won with an 83-78 lead and 24.7 seconds left. More NCS:  In D3, Carter Mahaney’s floater in the lane just before the buzzer gave second-seeded Campolindo-Moraga (22-6) a 70-68 overtime home win over third-seeded St. Patrick-St. Vincent-Vallejo (20-11), which got 22 points from Akil Edwards, who made a driving layup and free throw with 8.3 seconds left to tie the game 68-68.  David Ahazie had 25 points and Aidan Mahaney 18 for the Cougars. Jaden Alexander added 15 points for the Bruins. … Campolindo will play top-seeded Salesian (30-0), a 54-41 winner over St. Joseph Notre Dame-Alameda. … In D5 action, Charley Moore had 23 points and Max Fried added 18 points and 14 rebounds, leading second-seeded University (22-9) to a 79-62 win over visiting Clear Lake (26-3). Charlie Kennedy had eight second-half points for the Red Devils, who play top-seeded Stuart Hall (27-4), an 82-58 winner over fifth-seeded Hoopa Valley (21-8). In D2 play, Leonard Turner and Max Anderson had 12 points apiece, leading host and second-seeded Moreau Catholic-Hayward (23-7) to a 55-46 win over 14th-seeded Las Lomas-Walnut Creek (13-16). Moreau will play top-seeded Bishop O’Dowd-Oakland (21-7), a 56-46 winner over visiting and fourth-seed Redwood-Larkspur (23-8). … The top two seeds, Branson-Ross (28-2) and Fortuna (29-1), breezed to double-digit D4 victories. San Francisco Section Mission 76, Lowell 34:  In a semifinal at Kezar Pavilion, Ben Knight had 16 points, David Sonnier added 14 and Jaraughn Torno 12 as the top-seeded Bears (20-9) toppled the Cardinals (16-14), who got 12 points from Jace Ng. Lincoln 77, Washington 62:  Also at Kezar, Shakur Blaylock and Gabino Valdivia had 23 points apiece, leading the Mustangs (21-9) to a semifinal win over the Eagles (14-16), who got 20 points from Da’Jon Aranas. Central Coast Section Sacred Heart Cathedral 72, Menlo-Atherton 65:  Kori McCoy had 19 points, Cedric Reed Jr. 18 and Oisin McCormack 11 points and 16 rebounds, as the Irish (12-14) became the first CCS Open Division eighth seed to advance to the final with a semifinal victory at Independence-San Jose. James Beckwith scored all of his team-high 18 points for fourth-seed Menlo-Atherton (22-4). Bellarmine 68, Riordan 61:  Despite 27 points from Bryce Monroe, the second-seeded Crusaders (18-8) fell short in overtime against the third-seeded Bells (20-6) at Independence. Junior post Ian Elam (21 points) forced overtime with a contested interior bucket with 4.1 seconds left. GIRLS North Coast Section St. Joseph Notre Dame-Alameda 54, Cardinal Newman-Santa Rosa 47:  Zhane Duckett had 16 points, Malia Mastora 15 and Talana Lepolo 13, leading St. Joseph (22-6) to a win at Newman (24-5). Notre Dame will play top-seed Salesian (22-8), a 61-35 winner over Eureka (22-9).

The Warriors dropped to 16-10.SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — The hardest-working Giant at spring training is the employee responsible for updating the camp roster, which is like the weather in the tropics. If you don’t like it, wait 15 minutes. This week alone the Giants reached minor-league deals with catcher Stephen Vogt, outfielders Gerardo Parra and Craig Gentry, and, on Friday, former Padres infielder Yangervis Solarte. They also traded for Nationals reliever Trevor Gott. This was bound to happen in a slow free-agent market, as president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi followed through on his promise to tap into a buyer’s market for experienced help. The minor-league deals largely are formalities for some of the newcomers, particularly Parra and Solarte. Barring any strange developments, both should be on the Opening Day roster. Power-starved fans should welcome Solarte, 31, whose 17 homers for Toronto last year would have led the Giants by one. Solarte hit 16 before the All-Star break. His season went downhill with an oblique injury and a late-season Blue Jays youth movement that limited him to 103 at-bats after the All-Star break. Zaidi likes Solarte because he can play all over the infield and is willing to work in left field. Solarte was so excited about the prospect he offered to play center, too. Zaidi laughed as he relayed the story and said, “Ah, OK, we’ll wait on that.” Moreover, Solarte rarely strikes out and can draw a walk. “You don’t see that with double-digit power that much in the game anymore,” Zaidi said. “So it’s some hitting ability with some power and some contact, and a nice all-around package to be put in our lineup.” Zaidi probably is not done. Yes, the Bryce Harper pursuit remains alive. So are potential contingency signings and trades the club has discussed for months that could significantly alter the roster. But the river of journeyman signings will slow. The Giants believe competition is valuable, but they also want younger players such as infielders Alen  Hanson (who is out of minor-league options) and Abiatal Avelino, and outfielders Austin Slater and Drew Ferguson, to feel like they have a legitimate chance to make the team. “We want competition, but we don’t want this to be a reality show or a tryout camp,” Zaidi said. Solarte does not have a good defensive reputation, although Zaidi called him a “very competent defender.” “He’s a good hitter,” Giants catching hopeful and former Padres teammates Rene Rivera said, noting the dimensions at Petco Park did not faze Solarte even before the fences were moved in. “He has a good approach, and he has a good strike zone.” Manager Bruce Bochy said the club was “excited” to get Solarte, who, like Parra, brings familiarity with the National League West. Solarte was a Padre for more than three seasons after his 2014 acquisition from the Yankees in a deal for third baseman Chase Headley. Duggar’s progress:  Center fielder Steven Duggar took a big step  in his comeback from a dislocated shoulder when he took batting practice on the field for the first time. Bochy was about to install Duggar as the everyday leadoff hitter when he sustained the injury diving into second base Aug. 28. If Duggar makes the team as expected, he probably will hit first or second. Duggar batted in a group with Ryder Jones, who also hit outdoors for the first time since a September operation to repair a dislocated kneecap. Briefly:  Gentry, 35, will report to minor-league camp. He has played in 10 big-league seasons, including 2014-15 in Oakland. ... Just three days into workouts, the pitchers got a day off from throwing bullpen sessions. The Giants are serious about preserving arms with a long Cactus League and regular-season schedule ahead.A potential one-year Raiders’ layover at Oracle Park in San Francisco is not dead and could hinge largely on questions of territorial rights and unusual scheduling, a source told The Chronicle on Wednesday. The Raiders have been in continued negotiations to play 2019 home games at the Giants’ park before relocating to Las Vegas in 2020. It has been reported that an agreement would require the approval of the NFL and for the 49ers to waive their territorial rights in San Francisco. NFL Network reported  Tuesday that the 49ers were not expected to waive territorial rights, but the 49ers have not stated this. A source told The Chronicle that the 49ers, who have played home games at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara since 2014, may not have territorial rights to San Francisco. The NFL did not immediately respond to an email regarding the territorial-rights question. According to the source, scheduling would be a key factor in the Raiders sharing Oracle Park next season. Among the possible conditions are the Raiders playing no exhibition games or September home games at Oracle and scheduling divisional games in October in case the Giants make the playoffs and require the Raiders to swap home dates. The idea is that the Giants would want to avoid any scenario in which they play on a field that has been affected by football. However, the  October condition could create complications in that AFC West opponents also could be required to adjust their home dates on short notice. The Raiders would need to play seven regular-season  games at their temporary home next season. They are  scheduled to play one international “home” game in London against the Bears, with the date  to be determined. A temporary move to China Basin could face further hurdles. San Francisco Mayor London Breed voiced reservations Tuesday about the Raiders playing at Oracle Park in an interview with KTVU (Channel 2), saying: “As far as I’m concerned, the Oakland Raiders should play in Oakland. “In San Francisco, we have a number of challenges that we need to address with the Warriors coming to the new Chase Arena, the housing — 1,400 units — that’s going to break ground in that area, our transportation system, our ferry landing. “We have a number of things for years that we’ve been working to prepare for. And we don’t need another layer to add to what we already have in terms of an area that’s really congested, filled with construction, and will hold a number of concerts and games for both basketball and baseball over the coming months.” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said prior to the Super Bowl that he expected a resolution to the Raiders’ stadium situation soon and that he believes owner Mark Davis wants the Raiders to play in the Bay Area in 2019. Goodell said the league needs to know where the Raiders will be playing in order to make next season’s schedule. Other Bay Area solutions for the Raiders include sharing Levi’s Stadium for one season with the 49ers or returning for a final season at the Coliseum in Oakland. The Raiders withdrew from a tentative deal to play at the Coliseum in 2019 in December, one day after Oakland sued the Raiders and the NFL over the impending move to Las Vegas. Oakland has maintained the possibility of a new agreement with the Raiders to return for 2019 is  on the table.Some people call them “revenue games.” Others call them “paycheck” or “cupcake” games. Some refer to their opponents as “patsies.” Every year, dozens of absurd mismatches appear on the college football schedule, pitting lesser programs against  powerhouses. The big-name schools pay their patsies for the privilege, giving the smaller prorgrams a much-needed stream of revenue. The results are predictable. Last year, San Jose State went to Texas and got creamed 56-0. The Spartans limped home with $1 million in their coffers. On Saturday, Cal will host an overmatched Idaho State team in Strawberry Canyon. Stanford, ranked No. 9 in the country, will host the mighty Aggies of UC Davis. You can call this whatever you want. I’ll call it what it is: Wrong. Both sides of this ugly equation have their reasoning. The big-name schools want an easy win that brings them closer to a valuable berth in the NCAA’s lucrative postseason orgy of bowl games, the threshold for which — with rare exception — is six wins.  Once you devour that cupcake, you have only five to go. The smaller programs are in it for the money. Sacramento State and UC Davis don’t make a ton of cash on Saturdays. And their other athletic programs need a lot of financial support. So, they sacrifice the football team once or twice a year to raise money. Caesar would approve. Every year, you see the mismatches on college schedules. Football powerhouses playing low-profile schools. Texas vs. San Jose State. Cal vs. Presbyterian. Stanford vs. UC Davis. Why does college football feature these lopsided games, which the bigger schools usually win by landslide scores? The Chronicle investigates the questionable tradition of “revenue games.” To read the entire series, go to bit.ly/RevGames. Part 1 :  Why college football plays these annual blowouts. Part 2 :  What’s in it for the little programs? Part 3 :  San Jose State: How it makes millions. The losers in the scenario are twofold. The players are forced to compete against much larger and faster opponents. Though coaches and athletic administrators bend themselves into a pretzel defending the revenue games — mostly arguing that all football is violent and that the big stage is an honor for the members of the cupcake team — the laws of physics remain unbeaten and untied. When your opponent outweighs you by 50 pounds, something’s going to give ... quite possibly your knee. The fans are forced to watch horrible games that often are decided by the start of the second quarter. Better yet, they’re paying full price for the honor. Imagine if a pro team scheduled a pushover every once in awhile and charged you the same freight? Like the NFL preseason? It wouldn’t be right ... it isn’t right... as in just plain wrong. So, why does this farce come around, year after year, like a rerun of a bad movie? It’s college football, so you have all the usual forces at play. •The administrators are trying to keep as many sports going as possible. Football and men’s basketball are the only real revenue opportunities at most schools. But smaller schools don’t attract big crowds for either. So, athletic directors make the sacrificial bargain. “If we don’t put these 19-year-olds in grave physical danger, we’d have to cancel water polo!” •The coaches on both sides — big programs and small ones — go along with the plan. First, the coaches work for the athletic director. (See, previous paragraph.) The powerhouse programs get an easy win in a glorified scrimmage in which they can get a look at some of their second-string players for most of the game. The coaches at the smaller programs get a chance to play out a lifelong dream. “There I was, on the sideline at Ohio State....” The visiting cupcakes are football lifers, after all. Whatever size your team might be, surrender is not part of the gridiron vocabulary. “Our boys aren’t afraid!” •The NCAA hovers over the whole charade, saying things like teams should play the strongest schedule possible. But it does nothing substantial to discourage the practice. College football is a multibillion-dollar industry, fueled by rabid boosters and TV profits. As long as the machine is humming, don’t expect major reform. The suckers show up to watch, one way or another. We’ve watched these games for years and years. People love to bring up the rare upsets as justification. UC Davis beat Stanford one year. And remember when Appalachian State beat Michigan? Sure. It was a tremendous victory for the smaller school, but it’s no justification for this irresponsible tradition. At a time when it’s increasingly obvious that football is a game that can literally kill you, how can anyone justify putting these young men in such physical peril? We know what major head trauma can do to a player. We know what spinal cord trauma can do to a player. Yet, we send these kids out there, year after year, to get their heads kicked in. Why? Because it pays well. Shame on you, college football. Shame on you.Warriors guard Stephen Curry turned toward his teammates celebrating on the bench, covered his ears with his hands and mouthed, “Oh, my God,” as he ran back on defense. One might expect that reaction from Curry after he drained a deep 3-pointer late in a close playoff game. But in this instance, Curry was reveling in a basic two-handed dunk that he threw down with no one around him. Dunking, a perfunctory skill for most NBA players, has long been a luxury for Curry. Though he practices it daily, the two-time MVP requires a specific set of circumstances — gobs of space, plenty of time, the proper grip on the ball, a sufficient lead — to even attempt a dunk in a game. Not including his reverse dunk in the waning seconds of Sunday’s All-Star Game, Curry’s rudimentary slam Thursday against Sacramento was his first of the season. That matches his total from last season and eclipses the zero he threw down in 2011-12 and as a rookie in 2009-10. A decade into a Hall of Fame career, Curry is 26-for-29 on dunk attempts. Oklahoma City’s Russell Westbrook, perhaps the most aggressive point guard in the league, has made as many dunks in his least prolific season (2009-10) as Curry has in his entire professional life. “It doesn’t just happen by accident,” Curry said of  dunking. “It takes every bit of my attention. It’s not like, ‘Oh, I’m up here. Let me just dunk it.’” Added Golden State head coach Steve Kerr: “More than anything when he dunks, it’s just relief that it goes in.” Unlike many NBA players who consider their first dunk one of their fondest memories, Curry doesn’t quite remember when he first hammered a ball through a 10-foot-high hoop. His best guess put it sometime during his freshman year at Davidson. The problem wasn’t Curry’s jumping ability, which is actually much better than many might assume. He boasted a vertical leap of 35½ inches — 7½ inches better than the NBA average — at the pre-draft combine in 2009. Curry’s backcourt mate, Klay Thompson, has 19 dunks this season despite having just a 26½-inch vertical. The 6-foot-3 Curry has only average-size hands for his build, which can make palming the ball tricky. Getting a dunk off cleanly requires the time and space to ensure he has a firm grip. “I’ve had some fastbreak dunks where somebody’s been near me,” Curry said, “but there’s a reason I’ve never dunked on anyone.” In September 2014, after finishing his shooting routine with 10 free throws, Curry made eye contact with player-development coach Bruce Fraser and pointed toward the rim. Fraser tossed a lob and was amazed to see Curry finish the alley-oop with relative ease. Who:  Houston (33-25) at Warriors (42-16) When:  5:30 p.m.  TV/Radio: Channel: 7 95.7 Houston guard James Harden is questionable for Saturday’s game against the Warriors at Oracle Arena because of a cervical strain in his neck. Harden scored 30 points Thursday in the Rockets’ loss to the Lakers — his 32nd consecutive game reaching that mark. He played 37 minutes and received treatment on his right shoulder and neck during the game. — Chronicle staff It has been part of his routine ever since. On the rare occasions that Curry misses the dunk, it’s usually because of a misplaced lob from Fraser or one of the video interns. “It’s funny,” Fraser said. “You get guys like JaVale McGee, and they want to shoot threes. Then you’ve got a small guy like Steph, and he wants to dunk. Steph actually can jump and dunk pretty well when his legs are fresh.” Because his dunks are so  infrequent, Curry gets nervous when he sees a wide-open driving lane and decides to go up for one. Last month at Staples Center, after nabbing a steal and darting into an empty half-court, he felt some butterflies as he briefly envisioned the highlight-worthy slam he was about to throw down. But as he planted his feet to jump, Curry slipped on a wet spot — the potentially dangerous result of the NHL’s Los Angeles Kings playing a game there just hours earlier. Curry stood up, caught a pass from Andre Iguodala and promptly air-balled a corner 3-point try. During an appearance on James Corden’s “The Late Late Show” the following night, Curry explained, “In my head, I knew I was about to do something crazy, like a 360 dunk I’ve never done in my life. And, uh, it just didn’t happen.” Before replaying video of the blooper, Corden said, “You did something where I’m going to say it gave me hope because you did something, and you proved that you’re actually a human being.” The lingering memory of that botched attempt made Curry reluctant to try another one. In last week’s win over Utah, Curry planned to dunk on a breakaway, only to change his mind at the last second and lay it in. Kerr, who could tell Curry’s initial intentions based on his stride length, stood up and jokingly slow clapped. On Sunday, Curry was determined to put on a show for his hometown crowd at the All-Star Game in Charlotte, N.C. Video went viral of him tossing himself an alley-oop during warm-ups and throwing down a 360-degree dunk. On the game’s final play, Curry served himself up with an alley-oop reverse slam, hanging on the rim for emphasis. Asked Thursday about his latest, more basic dunk, he said, “All I needed was to see one go in in Charlotte, so watch out.”In late October, The Chronicle published a six-part series examining The Future of Football. The premise was simple: Now that we know the sport can cause lasting brain damage, driving some to suicide, what are we going to do about it? A dedicated team of Chronicle journalists spent months digging into the subject. You can read the whole thing at  www.sfchronicle.com/future-of-football . In a letter to Chronicle subscribers, I encouraged response. What do you think should be done? What will the game look like in 20 years? Let me share a few of those voices. Thanks, your reflection is so important. I did love your projection that football would look like boxing. Why the continued ignorance with little effort to address the problem? Frederick E. Heslet, San Francisco All your main recommendations make logical sense and are the right thing to do. I was lucky that I was too small for playing grade school football. My coach realized this, I believe, and I sat on the bench. My mother always feared I would get seriously injured. With regard to parents and kids now, ultimately people need to make their own decisions about what to do with regard to their children playing football. If flag football is an option, that would be great. I believe sooner than later, American football as we know it won’t be as popular. Instead, people will migrate to lesser injury-prone sports that are also rewarding for fans, parents, schools and students. John Durham, Napa The Chronicle’s “The Future of Football” series looked at mounting evidence that has linked football violence with brain trauma and life-threatening conditions. Now that we know the sport can produce deadly results, where do we go from here? To read the entire series, go to  www.sfchronicle.com/future-of-football . Everybody’s jumping on the football-is-dangerous bandwagon. This story is long-winded bull. All major sports have physical contact. Soft s— wimps are ruining this country and turning our men into soft little p—. Look at the average 20-something male today, weak wimps worrying about the next superhero or Star Wars movie. All this coddling and whining is pathetic. Name withheld I’m 68. I played for four years in high school and a year of college. I never finished a season. Mostly knee injuries but I broke my thumb in college in a way that required surgery. I also boxed in college. I attended a 49ers camp for high school students where a very aggressive game of “touch” resulted in a hit that caused me to lose vision in one eye for a few plays. Naturally, I stayed in the game. So far, it hasn’t caught up to me. Anyway, I think one partial solution is to make all the pads and helmets soft on both the inside  . Also, I think many knee injuries could be eliminated if there were no cleats. Leif Ortegren, Petaluma Step 1. Change the channel. The rest of it really won’t matter so much. Greg Tolman, Berkeley Ultimate frisbee! All quarterbacks, no linebackers. Spike Connor, Redwood City It would be interesting to know whether rugby has the same level of problems with brain trauma as football. Rugby players wear no helmets or padding, and there are strict rules about tackling. I suspect that the protective gear in football increases the incidence of brain trauma, because it allows players to hit each other harder. It doesn’t take a direct head impact to cause a concussion. The sudden acceleration from a hard hit can do it, even if there’s no head contact. In rugby, players are less inclined to use their bodies as weapons when tackling because it could cause injury to the tacklers. It’s counter-intuitive, but reducing the amount of protective gear in football could make it a safer sport. The culture of the sport has to change, too. Players, coaches, fans, broadcasters and reporters have to stop seeing a disabling hit as a good thing. Jeff Lichtman, El Cerrito Bravo. End this disgusting sport. There’s 5,472 more peaceful ways for young people to “build character.” Chris Moffat, San Ramon Great articles on the game of football. If you get a chance, read some of the books or articles on John Gagliardi, the St. John’s University Division III coach whose philosophy on the game of football was so different than any coach I have known. Even in the ’50s and ’60s, no tackling in practice, no practice longer than 90 minutes, water breaks, etc. His philosophy worked. He won more football games (489) than any coach in NCAA history along with four national championships. I played for John in the 1960s on one of his championship teams. We never had anyone hurt in practice except for the occasional ankle sprain. We had a few transfers from schools like the University of Minnesota where Murray Warmath coached with the philosophy of making the practices tougher than the games, kind of a survival-of-the-fittest code. This was not unusual at that time. Football needs to change. Again, thanks for the great articles. Terry Underwood, Corte Madera Here’s a modest proposal: Make everyone eligible (why linemen aren’t eligible for passes has always been a mystery to me). This is somewhat more radical than the A-10 offense (I think that’s what it was called) that the Piedmont High coaches developed, and was voted down by NFHS, but it would keep the nature of the game intact while changing it dramatically. If everyone is eligible, the game will spread out, and there will be more of a premium on speed and agility than raw size. Power football will make less sense, and just as the three-point line and the Warriors’ style has pretty much removed the power game from basketball (especially at the lower levels), there will be a shift toward more scoring and use of the whole field. It’s not a complete or perfect solution, of course, but it moves the game away from one-on-one contact and toward skill and speed. Clay Kallam, Walnut Creek The late U.S. Sen. Gene McCarthy (D-Minn.) had a great line: “Football is like politics. You have to be smart enough to understand the game, and dumb enough to think it’s important.” Eric Mills, Oakland Thanks to all of our readers who responded. Interestingly, we didn’t get much from people defending the sport, as it stands. Maybe we’re preaching to the choir here in the Bay Area. Maybe people are starting to see the truth.MESA, Ariz. — Take one element away from Parker Bridwell’s statistics in his big-league career, and things change dramatically. That item: his numbers against the A’s. He has allowed 67 earned runs since coming up in 2016, and the A’s account for 22 of them. His career ERA against Oakland: 20.48. Against everyone else: 3.34. Seven of the 26 career homers Bridwell has allowed have been hit by the A’s. So as Bridwell told Oakland manager Bob Melvin the first day of camp, “If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.” “It’s one of those things as a pitcher you always say, ‘Have a short memory. Don’t worry about the things you can’t control,’ but I don’t think it’s possible to forget everything and I obviously had some bad outings against Oakland,” Bridwell said. “The majority of my bad outings, really. But I’m not the only one who’s struggled against them, and that says a lot about their lineup. “They get on base. They do the little things. They’re trying to see lots of pitches for the next guy behind them, and I found myself deep in the count every time against them, it felt like. I couldn’t put together a good start against them. As much as you want to be mentally tough, it’s always in the back of your head if you struggle with one lineup. Every time it seemed like before four innings, I’d given up five runs on the scoreboard. I’m glad I’m in this clubhouse now.” Two seasons ago was a good example.  Bridwell went 10-3 with a 3.63 ERA overall, and the Angels went 17-3 in the rookie’s starts despite the fact he  allowed 13 earned runs over six innings in two outings against the A’s. “It was one of those things. I didn’t have anything to lose after getting designated” for assignment by Baltimore, Bridwell said of his 2017 season. “Once I got to Anaheim, I was going to let it fly, pound the zone and let the defense play behind me.” “Parker was great for us,” Angels general manager Billy Eppler said. “He was so coachable, so open to new ideas, such a competitor. Just the way he handled adversity and pressure — I had veteran guys come up to me and tell me, ‘You don’t have to worry about that guy. He’s fine. He knows what he’s doing. He’s going to be a good one.’” Eppler said that Bridwell might carry himself differently than other young players because he was a star high school quarterback growing up in Hereford, Texas, about 50 miles southwest of Amarillo. Bridwell took Hereford High School three rounds deep into the playoffs his sophomore and senior seasons and he committed to Texas Tech to play both football and baseball before choosing to sign with the Orioles out of high school. “I started football earlier than baseball and I got to learn from really good quarterbacks,” among them former Texas Tech quarterback Cody Hodges, Bridwell said. “You have to learn to throw a spiral in the Panhandle or it’s not going to go anywhere because of the wind. “It was awesome, just like ‘Friday Night Lights.’ They shut the town down and everybody is at the game. Until I got to the big leagues, I hadn’t felt adrenaline like there is with Friday night football. Playing football taught me a lot about how to handle myself on the mound. You learn to slow things down.” Last year was a tough one for Bridwell: He needed surgery to remove a bone spur from his elbow, costing him four months, and he pitched in just five big-league games and six minor-league games. “I’m good now, I’m healthy and I’m just coming in every day and taking care of my business,” Bridwell said. “If at the end of spring training they’d like to take me as one of the starters, I’d be honored.” The A’s snatched up Bridwell, 27, on waivers  Jan. 22. They believe the 6-foot-4 right-hander can get back to his 2017 self now that he’s healthy — and with them. “He’s a tall guy, he’s got some downward plane. He’s talented,” Melvin said. “Sometimes that can get in your head, ‘There’s a team I just can’t get out.’ To have that team be us that he’s playing for now I’m sure doesn’t hurt his demeanor at all.”TUCSON — Ryan Luther scored 19 points and Arizona ended its longest losing streak in 36 years with a 76-51 victory over Cal  on Thursday night. The Wildcats (15-12, 6-8 Pac-12) were solid defensively all night and turned on the offense in the second half to end a skid at seven games. Cal (5-21, 0-14) had another ugly offensive night to extend its school-record losing streak to  15 games. The Bears shot 30 percent and went 6-for-26 from beyond the  arc to remain winless in the Pac-12 since Feb. 3 of last year. “They’re pressing a little,” Cal head coach Wyking Jones said. “Guys want to make plays and they want to get back into the win column so bad that we’re not allowing ourselves to slow down and make the right play.” Justice Sueing led Cal with 18 points. Luther led the second-half charge with 13 points. For the night, he went 5-for-8 from long range. Arizona won the first meeting with Cal 87-65 in Berkeley on Jan. 12. Since then, the Wildcats have gone into a tailspin, losing eight of nine to go from an NCAA Tournament possibility to hoping for an NIT berth. In the early going, Arizona and Cal played like two teams with a combined 21 straight losses, clanking shots and trading turnovers. The Wildcats got better. The Bears didn’t.Stanford almost got more than it could handle Friday night from Arizona, a team it had beaten by 30 in Tucson last month. The Cardinal women held off the Wildcats 56-54 at Maples Pavilion, thanks to a clutch 3 by Alanna Smith and a near-miss at the buzzer by Arizona’s Aari McDonald. It was Stanford’s seventh straight win over Arizona and its 33rd in the last 34 meetings between the two schools. Stanford looked out of sync most of the night and shot just 37 percent from the field. Stanford had 3s by Lacie Hull and Smith to close Arizona’s lead to 54-53 with two minutes left. McBryde missed a 3 with 36 seconds to go. Smith got the rebounds and then hit her big 3 for a 56-54 lead with 29 seconds to go. Kiana Williams fouled McDonald, but the Arizona star missed both foul shots with 17 seconds left. Still, the Cats weren’t dead. Destiny Graham stole the ball, and Arizona called timeout with 10 seconds left. McDonald got off what would have been a game-winning 3 with 1 second left, but the ball rimmed out. Stanford (22-4, 12-3 Pac-12) had 21 points from Alanna Smith, 15 from Lacie Hull and 10 from DiJonai Carrington. McDonald, the nation’s third leading scorer with a 24.8-point average, had 20 points. Graham, who attended Eastside College Prep in Palo Alto, added 11 for the Wildcats (17-9, 7-8). The Wildcats showed their claws in a low-scoring first half. McDonald had 12 points in the half, which ended with the Cardinal up 35-27. The lead was just 13-12 after one quarter. Stanford made just one of its first 3-point tries before Smith nailed one on her way to a 15-point first half. Kiana Williams sank a triple, and Stanford’s last two baskets of the first half were 3s by Lacie Hull. Sophomore forward Maya Dodson returned to action for Stanford after missing the last two games and 10 conference games in all with a foot injury. The Cardinal play their final home game of the regular season against No. 17 Arizona State on Sunday at 1 p.m.SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — In the two days after Bruce Bochy announced  he would retire as the Giants’ manager after the season , one phrase kept escaping the lips of those who were asked for their reaction. “He’s just a dying breed,” pitcher Jeff Samardzija said. “Dying breed” can mean different things to different people. Samardzija meant it in human terms. “Unfortunately, after this, you’re going to have 30 puppets out there giving you cliche answers, and it’s a shame because Bochy isn’t that,” Samardzija said. “He’s a person. He’s got great stories. He’s a motivator, and on top of all that, he loves his players. “It’s tough to see him go. Hopefully, there’s another Bochy out there somewhere.” The game still has a lot of Bochys, chaw-dippers (or recently reformed dippers) who manage by the seat of their pants, play hunches, and prefer sharing a beer with old-time contemporaries rather than monitoring spin rates and launch angles. They are just not getting  managerial jobs. Nobody can deny the trend toward managers who are cheaper to hire, less celebrated, more fungible and desired for their willingness to coordinate game management with data-driven front offices. But old-time managers as a dying breed? Not quite yet. Though new hires skew younger, a majority of major-league managers (16 of 30) are 50 or older. The group still boasts some large personalities, including Clint Hurdle (Pirates), Terry Francona (Indians), Ned Yost (Royals), Bud Black (Rockies) and Don Mattingly (Marlins). Some have survived by adapting to the new normal in baseball management, which throws a wrench into the cliched dichotomy between cranky old men who roll their eyes at Ivy League  general managers and young’uns who have seen the sabermetric light. Bochy’s contemporaries have long suspected that the 63-year-old has adapted more than he acknowledged. “He didn’t miss anything,” said new Reds manager David Bell, who watched Bochy from afar before working with him for one year as the Giants’ farm director. “I think he was factoring a lot more (data) than he let on. I don’t think you can have that much success without being hungry for information.” Francona is four years younger than Bochy and entering his 19th season as a big-league manager. When asked if he felt part of a dying breed, he said no. “I understand the question,” Francona said. “I’m getting up there in years, but I’m not made to feel that way here. We are very progressive. We talk about collaboration all the time. It’s something I’ve really enjoyed. They go to great lengths to get me the information I can use during a game and in a way that I understand.” Francona and Bell were among the 15 Cactus League managers who gathered in Glendale, Ariz., for an annual media day Tuesday just as news of Bochy’s pending retirement was beginning to spread. The group agreed that no matter how Bochy is viewed within the context of modern managing, his clubhouse skills were unparalleled and should not go out of style. “Bochy does that better than anybody,” Francona said. “He knows people, and you can never replace that in this game. If you do, I’ll do something else.” Bell concurred: “What I hope isn’t a dying breed is the way he communicates and the way he gains the respect from his players by treating them fairly and caring about them and supporting them. That, in the end, is the difference-maker.” Several managers said they look forward to facing Bochy one more time before a well-deserved retirement. That included Dave Roberts, who played for Bochy in San Diego and San Francisco and now manages against him with the Dodgers. “I will say the 18 or 19 times we see these guys I’m going to enjoy competing against him,” Roberts said. “Next year, when somebody else is leading that ballclub, it’s going to be different.”More than two years after Robbie Gould was released by Chicago, it sure sounds like the 49ers’ kicker wants to be reunited. When the Bears ended their 11-season relationship with Gould in September 2016, the franchise’s career scoring leader penned a letter to the “greatest fans in the NFL” that ended with this: “Once a Bear, always a Bear.” Twenty-nine months later, Gould appeared on 670 The Score in Chicago on Sunday, and his 22-minute interview ended with him saying this: “Once a Bear, always a Bear.” Gould’s wife, who is from suburban Chicago, and his three young sons have stayed in Chicago during Gould’s two seasons in Santa Clara. He is building a home outside the city he has called home since 2005, and he wants his kids to grow up as Chicago sports fans. As it happens, the local football team hasn’t adequately replaced Gould. In fact, the Bears’ 2018 season ended when Cody Parkey capped an erratic debut season in Chicago by missing a 43-yard field-goal try with five seconds left in a 16-15 wild-card playoff loss to Philadelphia. This all leads to a pertinent question for the 49ers as it pertains to their near-automatic kicker: Will Gould, 36, scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent, be a Bear again when free agency opens March 13? “The thing for me is it’s going to be the best place to win (and) the best place for my family,” Gould said, “and obviously that opportunity will come up and we’ll make those decisions.” But here’s the thing: It might not be Gould’s decision to make. NFL teams can begin applying the franchise tag to one player on their roster Tuesday, and Gould is the 49ers’ only logical candidate to receive the designation (the franchise-tag period ends March 5). The one-year franchise tag will be about $5 million for kickers. If it’s applied, Gould could be the NFL’s highest-paid kicker in 2019, but the second-most-accurate kicker in NFL history has earned a significant raise after signing a two-year, $4 million deal in 2017. With the 49ers, Gould has made 72 of 75 field-goal attempts, which is the most accurate two-season stretch in NFL history among kickers with at least 50 attempts. Last year, Gould led the NFL in field-goal percentage (97.1). Parkey ranked 30th (76.7) and missed as many regular-season kicks (seven) in 30 attempts as Gould has missed in his past 105 tries dating to 2015. However, Parkey has $3.5 million in guaranteed money in 2019, and he would count $5 million in dead cap space if released. The Bears are projected to have about $20 million in cap space. “Cody’s obviously the kicker for the Chicago Bears,” Gould said on The Score. “They have a lot of things they would have to do in order for it to work. And those are all things that you never know what’s going to happen, right? “We’re all ears if we get to (free agency) and we’ll take it in stride. We’d definitely consider all opportunities when we get to that free-agent part, for sure.” Gould said Sunday that he’s seeking at least a three-year contract. Given his family considerations and desire to “give myself a chance to win a Super Bowl,” he likely wouldn’t welcome the one-year franchise tag from the 49ers, who went 4-12 in 2018. The 49ers, who are projected to have more than $60 million in cap space, can sign Gould to a contract extension. Last month, however, general manager John Lynch said such a deal wasn’t imminent. “We’re hopeful to work things out with Robbie,” Lynch said. “And he’s kicked unbelievably for us. He’s been incredibly clutch for us. And we’d like to reward him for that.” The franchise tag can strain relationships between teams and players, who often are seeking more long-term security. Still, it would be surprising if the 49ers didn’t apply the tag to Gould because they don’t fit his criteria. It’s possible the 49ers could part with Gould and explore free-agent options that could include New England’s Stephen Gostkowski, Minnesota’s Dan Bailey and longtime Falcon Matt Bryant, all of whom rank in the top 10 in career field-goal percentage. Bryant, who recently was released by Atlanta, played for 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan with the Falcons, but will be 44 in May. Bailey, 31, is coming off a disappointing debut with the Vikings after the Cowboys released him before the 2018 season. For his part, Gould often sounded Sunday as if he was destined to reach free agency. “I’ve made calculated decisions my whole career,” he said, “and I’m going to do the same thing whenever this decision that we have to make comes up.” Will it really be Gould’s decision to make? It could be wishful thinking, or perhaps Gould knows something about the 49ers’ franchise-tag intentions. This can be said with certainty: When it comes to his future, we’ll soon see if one of the most trustworthy kickers in NFL history is accurate again.SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Come to Arizona, they said. Enjoy the sunny climes and good times. No one said anything about snow. But sure enough, there it was on the peaks surrounding Scottsdale on Friday morning. A crazy cold snap had transformed this normally balmy town into a meat locker. Which isn’t very conducive to baseball. Just the same, the Giants soldiered on, shivering through an abbreviated workout in the rain on the last day of spring training before the real fake games start. The big chill was the talk of camp. “It snowed at my house last night,” Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford said. “I’ve never seen that before.” He wasn’t smiling. “This is Brooklyn weather!” crowed Giants’ coach Shawon Dunston, a New York native who learned a thing or two about playing in the cold as a kid. “You California people are spoiled!” Manager Bruce Bochy took a more philosophical approach. “There’s nothing you can do about it. It’s Mother Nature. You deal with it,” said Bochy, warming up in his office after the workout. “It’s like during the season. There’s going to be days where you have bad weather. ... These guys were great today. It was cold, but they got their work in. I’m not going to lie. It would be nice to get our Arizona weather. “It’s a good thing to talk about, I guess.” Never thought I’d get to take a short drive to see the snow! Currently in Carefree.  #azwx   #azweather   #snowacrossthevalley   #carefree   @CoryFOX10   @FOX10Phoenix   pic.twitter.com/I0FriWfLuk Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper said it reminded him of Opening Day weather ... in Cleveland. The ballplayers weren’t the only ones focused on the wacky weather. The city of Scottsdale actually suspended trash pickups in parts of town due to the snow. Some schools were shut down. Flagstaff, Ariz., recorded at least 3 feet of the white stuff. It even snowed in Tucson. Despite the chill in the air, and the snow on the ground, this is still spring training. Which means everyone has hope. “It’s supposed to be clear for our first game tomorrow,” Crawford said. And no chance of flurries. This is really happening!  Due to hazardous road conditions caused by SNOW ❄️, trash & recycling pickup will not occur today in areas north & south of Happy Valley Road, east of Pima Road. We want to keep things safe & will return Saturday, Feb. 23, to collect the missed areas.  pic.twitter.com/14Skeq9ambFRIDAY Baseball Spring training 10a Northeastern vs. Boston  MLBNet Noon A’s vs. Seattle ( MLBNet  joins in progress, approximately 12:45 p.m.) College basketball Men 3:30p Bowling Green at Ohio  CBSSN 4p Kent State at Buffalo  ESPN2 4p Canisius at Monmouth  ESPNU 4p Dartmouth at Yale  ESPNews 6p Davidson at Rhode Island  ESPN2 6p Indiana at Iowa  FS1 6p Wisconsin-Green Bay at Illinois-Chicago  ESPNU Women 6p USC at Oregon State  P12Net 7p Arizona at Stanford 7p Arizona State at Cal  P12BA 8p UCLA at Oregon  P12Net Golf 7:30a PGA: Puerto Rico Open  GolfCh. 11a WGC: Mexico Championship  GolfCh. 8:30p LPGA: Thailand Open  GolfCh.

    "As shown by the plot of the tokenized business text, some of the noteworthy words include company, work, San Francisco, market, and million. From this information, we can make an inference that the related topics that business articles are currently talking about have to do with various companies and it seems like they are typically talking about financial aspects of companies. For example, year, market, and million could relate to a companies yearly reports. Since this is a section of business technology, \"new\" also makes sense since articles can also be talking about new products or services being offered by a company. \n",
    "\n",
    "When taking a look at the tokenized local text, some noteworthy words that pop up are year, San Francisco, city, people, help, home, fund, need, and time. Drawing from this, articles seem to be relating to potential needs of the people of San Francisco (since this is local for the Chroncile) due to key words such as help, need, and want. Funds also relates to this since helping in certain areas such as hospitals or such may require funds. Lastly, fire makes sense for the current reports due to the fairly recent gas explosion that occurred in San Francisco (this also relates to home and help).\n",

    "Finally, for the tokenized sports text, sports seems to be mostly occupied by football articles. In addition to this, articles for all sports typically describe the games with score, plays made in the games, team dynamics, and season logistics. As shown by the frequency of common words, game, play, team, point, season, and score are all present, which does point to this. Interestingly, state and school are more frequent than nfl; therefore, the articles could be mostly about developing talent from schools rather than the actual league itself at this moment. \n",

    "***How does the category affect the topic***\n",
    "\n",
    "The category of the topic affects what the topic typically is. For example, when searching the business category, topics will generally revolve around companies and financial data; however, when searching the sports category, topics will generally revolve around professional or college sports, the games that come from it, and any analysis surrounding those games. \n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a look at distributions, the distributions of business and sports are fairly similar in that the first two or three common words are much more common relative to the rest of their common words. When looking at local articles, their common words have a less dramatic downward trend from left to right. This could be explained by how local articles are a much broader topic than sports and business. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Limitations***\n",
    "\n",
    "The preface, these topics of the three categories were hypothesized from finding the most common words present in articles. With this in mind, there will be some obvious limitations that even though there may be a large frequency of a word doesn't necessarily mean that it directly shows what the topics of the category are currently.
